 This work, which has been announced severaltimes as in progress, is at length completed and offeredto the public. It is a neat duodecimo volumeof 316 pages, with a mezzotint likeness of Lundy,and a colored map of Texas and Mexico. The titlepage reads thus: 'The Life, Travels and Opinionsof Benjamin Lundy, including his Journeys loTexas and Mexico; with a sketch of contemporaryevents, and a notice of the Revolution in Hayti.Compiled under the direction and on behalf of hischildren. Merribew &Thompson, Printers.' Of course, such a volume must possess muchinterest Benjamin Lundy was the Pioneer in themodern anti-slavery movement, and, more thanany other man, its originator. He devoted himselfto the cause of the slave at an early age, and withthe most admirable self-sacrifice, and extraordinaryendurance, labored to the day of his death for itsprosecution, His frequent visits to Texas andMexico, though of no avail in the immediate advancementof the cause, were of immense servicein the developments which they enabled him tomake of the plots and plans which resulted in theTexas rebellion. To the facts brought out byBenjamin Lundy, John Quincy Adams was mainlyindebted for the material of his early and able anti-Texas speeches in Congress. The book before us is mainly a compilation, theeditor being 'solicitous,' as he says in his preface,'to avoid giving offence to any class of emancipationists,'by mixing up his own opinions with thefacts recorded. Possibly—for we have not yetread the whole of the work—this may be no disadvantagein the present case, but ordinarily a biographyis indebted for at least one half of its valueto the comments, reflections and deductions of itseditor. This book, however, contains sufficient of interestto make it amply worth ha pries, and we shouldbe glad, on account of those more immediatelyinterested in its proceeds, to hear of its finding aready sale.—Pennsylvania Freeman.
