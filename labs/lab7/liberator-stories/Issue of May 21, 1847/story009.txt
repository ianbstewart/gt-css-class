The emancipationof the children, leaving the parents in slavery.is said to work the most injurious effects; and itis necessary to make them all free or all slaves.The parents can entertain only hatred against society,where it denies to them what it bestows upontheir children. The liberty of all, the writer goon,is a thing which toe Legislature may hasten.but cannot delay.
