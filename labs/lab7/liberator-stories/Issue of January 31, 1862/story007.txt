 We trust that no good citizens and patriot read thetelegraphic report in yesterday's paper of Mr. ThaddeusStevens's fanatical and insane ravings withoutindignation and disgust. The madness and recklessnessof such language at such a time are inconceivable;we can compare the man who talks in thisbedlamitish strain to nothing so much as to a mischievousmonkey playing with fire in the magazineof a splendid line-of-battle ship. But Mr. Stevensis no inconsiderable person, but the Chairman of theCommittee of Ways and Means, and the leader, soto say, of the House of Representatives; and thushis words are not like water spilled upon the ground,but rather the dragon's teeth that sprang up armedmen. The President of the United States has exercisedpretty liberally during the past year the privilegeof arrest and imprisonment during his pleasure;if such powers are to be used at all, we recommendMr. Stevens as a proper subject for them. Wewould not send him to Fort Warren or Fort Lafayette,but simply to the nearest lunatic asylum,where he may have his head shaved, a large blisterput on between the shoulder-blades, and be fed onbrad, water, oat-meal gruel and other anti-phlogisticdiet, till returning reason re-assume its away.â€”BostonCourier.
