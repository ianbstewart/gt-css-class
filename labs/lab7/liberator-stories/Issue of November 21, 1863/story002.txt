 "T is true, and pity it is 't is true," that the puri,so wedded as they are to the absurd idea of equality, can never be cured of this unnatural, and that the lessons of the hour, which arerating so beneficially all over the country, reUtterly unheeded in New England. This is aentable fact. Nearly two years' experience of operations of this delusion merely includes thelakes to "lay the flattering unction to his soul" he can change the Ethiopian skin, and make the peer of white men! What folly, whatlness, what iniquity! Everybody beyond the of these fanatics knows and feels that this monniahas alone caused our deplorable nationalbles; and yet, instead of acknowledging their; and retracing their steps, these blind zealotslly pursue their will o'-the-whisp of EmancipateEnquiry, &C.                  Mr. Frank Bird is a fair type of these enthusiasts.He may be a good business man, but sure we are that will never be a statesman. He may excel in themanufacture of paper, but certain it is that, beyondkee land, be can never manufacture, on paperotherwise, that reputation as a public man which from practical common sense. He has justeen elected one of Gov. Andrew's Councilors,less as a reward for his endeavors to introduceto Massachusetts several thousand contrabands the southern border, in order to degrade and the price of labor. All this might be rewith indifference, were the fanatics to conthemselves to their chosen task; but, to securecountenance of their roundhead brethren, they needs institute comparisons between the neand Irishmen. Mr. Bird, to bolster his preciousnotions, prints, in the Transcript of last, a letter from "a gentleman of the highest inand character," from Fortress Monroe, the and meaning of which is contained in this de tableextract:—            Transcript  "a gentleman of the highest inand character,"   "The colored people are as active and industriesand capable as the Irish. They are much moremanaged, and as the Irish are at the Northernthe negro in the south, each in their morenative latitude, so let it be."   We hear continually of the comparative insignificanceof the slaveholders; but, in point of fact,they far more truly represent the opinions of the fifteen Southern States than the Black Republicansof New England do those of the FreeStates; because these six States contain much less two millions inhabitants, radical, conservative,,niggers, and all; and no sane man will underto say that nonsense contained in the abovegraph could receive from the twenty-five or millions of the people besides, any other retionthan well-merited derision or contempt.Where else, on the surface of this globe, can individualsbe found so stultified as to compare an Irishto a negro! If the latter be as "capable" as "Irish," pray why not as much and more sothan the fanatical, amalgamation-hunting, dollarworshipping, atheistical Yankee? The idea of the being here "in their more native latitude," is,ring everything, most decidedly rich! worthily the logic of those disturbers of order, goodgovernment, and every social relation.         negro!   "in their more native latitude,"   This wiseacre says:— "If the Irish are not blinded to their own inthey will go as a body, all over the land, foreral emancipation."   However much Mr. Bird and his colleagues in had business may pride themselves on theirSuperior mental (?) endowments, the Irish, thank have too much self-respect to "go" for anythingthat will place a negro on the same grade inthe Labor-market with themselves. What a cause congratulation to the poorest white man is thetion that, unlike the inferior negro race, he isrty to remove withers ever his inclination orinterests may prompt him! But to "go" for theemancipation of four millions of helpers slaves,without the least regard for their immediate to rewell-being, is a thought worthy altogether of impracticable ideologists who are ever pursome silly phantom, whose notions of governmentcould not last, if once tried, for twenty-four, and whose only strength consists in mutualration, and for all else inextinguishable anim.Oh! New England! Verily it is high time-learned the teachings of Old England of centuries ago:—Boston (Irish Catholic) Pilot.              Boston (Irish Catholic) Pilot.
