 Governor Andrew's letter to Major Bolles, decliningthe proposed transfer of contrabands fromFortress Monroe to Massachusetts, has been published.It is suspected that Major Bolles, who Icomparatively fresh from Massachusetts politicsproposed to make a little democratic capital out ofthis affair; but the attempt has failed signally. Indeed,the Governor's letter is an excellent documentfor use in replying to the insane clamor as toan intended or expected removal of free blacks tothe North. After urging that, if Fortress Monroeis threatened by the enemy, General Dix wouldfind the blacks an important reserved force for itsdefence, Governor Andrew proceeds as follows:— "Contemplating, however, the possibility of theirremoval, permit me to say that the Northern Statesare, of all places, the worst possible to select for anasylum. These poor people, afloat upon the world,are inhabitants of a Southern climate, and havehabits, and are subject to needs and to peculiaritiesof physical constitution accordingly. Where, then,is the prudence or the humanity or subjecting thenat once to the rigors of our northern sky, in thewinter season, with the moral certainty of inflictingextreme suffering, resulting probably in disease anddeath? If their removal is definitely determinedupon, I would take the liberty of suggesting for theasylum some Union foothold in the South—as HiltonHead—where they could retain their health, betrained as soldiers, and their labor be renderedeconomically available. For them to come here forencampment or asylum would be to come to paupersand sufferers into a strange land, and a climatetrying even to its habitués, as a swarm of homelesswanderers, migrating without purpose, and not tothe wilderness where the strong arm would sufficefor maintenance, but to a busy community wherethey would be incapable of self-help—a course certainto demoralize themselves and endanger others.Such an event would be a handle to all traitors andto all persons evilly disposed. We should be toldthat the experiment had been tried and had failed;that the negroes were proved worthless, and incapableof taking care of themselves, when the truthwould be that we had pursued the plan most eminentlycalculated to disable and corrupt them. Imeet with pleasure the motives of humanity whichhave dictated your proposed plan; but from thevery same feelings I must consider the plan mistaken.It is precisely because I do not wish thenegroes to suffer; precisely because I would savetheir wives and children from perishing; preciselybecause I do not wish their new freedom to becomelicense, corruption and infamy, that I respectfullydecline to aid or countenance your plan for theirtransportation to the North. Imuch as the letter of Major-General Dix iaccompanied by a copy of a letter from the WarDepartment granting permission to correspond conveningthe plan proposed, I deem it incumbentupon me to state that I have, since receiving yourletter, conferred with the Department upon thissubject, and I am sure that there is not any differenceof opinion between the Department and myselfthereon; nor do I find there the existence ofany such apprehensions regarding the safety of Gen.Dix's position as you seem to entertain.   I ought to add that, even were my views coincidentwith your own, I am, under the law, absolutelypowerless in my official capacity to promote them".
