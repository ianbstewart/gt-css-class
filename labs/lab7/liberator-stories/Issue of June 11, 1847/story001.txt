 'The deliberate insult to the people and governmentof the United States, lately perpetrated bythe managers of the Canard line of steamers, atthe instigation of the British press, and with theapproval, no doubt, of the British government,may now be resented in the only manner which theauthors of such an insult are capable of feeling.No American, who his any respect for himself orhis country, can henceforth embark in one of thecoward steamers. To safety every true American of his duty inregard to the Cunard line of steamers—the line,carrying the English mail, from Boston, via Halifax,to Liverpool—we have only to state the fact,in it since the last passage of the negro Douglass,an order has been given, that negroes shall be entitledto all privileges of first cabin passengers. Anyman may Sad himself seated everyday at the dinnertable, with a negro on each side of him, and ifhe does not take an entire state-room, may be compelledto share it with a negro. His wife anddaughters may be seated opposite his own bootblack, or walking the quarter-deck, may be tenderedthe polite civilities of his artist in whitewash. American passengers on this line of steamers haveheretofore been compelled to listen to a negro lecturer,abusing their country and institutions; andnow, by an express order, they are to be compelledto associate with negroes on terms of equality. We are satisfied that the statement of this factwill be sufficient. Let the Cunard line henceforthbe appropriated expressly to negroes, and their Englishand abolitions friends, while the French andAmerican lines will receive, as they will merit, thepatronage of the rest of the world.
