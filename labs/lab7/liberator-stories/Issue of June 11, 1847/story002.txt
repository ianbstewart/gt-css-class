 ANOTHER DOUGLASS IN THE FIELD. The 'Fugitiveshare' business appears to be profitable. Wehave now an ingenious darkey who is' followingin the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor,' andwho will probably go to England, as cabin passengerin one of the Cunard nigger steamers, andmake perhaps, as great a sensation as Douglasshimself. Henry Bibb, the romantic name of thisself-emancipated darkey, was born in Kentuckyand according to his story, has been sold six times,the last time to the Cherokee Indians, fromwhom he escaped. This is a good story, and willtell well in England. NOTHER OUGLASS IN THE IELD. Should Bibb be successful, especially in his Englishtour, mingling freely with the aristocracy, weshall have fugitive slaves in abundance. Anthonystreet will turn out a score of them, and they willbe as plenty as blackberries; and they willbe able to supply the market they will be manufacturedto hand in London, till even British sympathyones— 'hold! enough!'— N.Y.
