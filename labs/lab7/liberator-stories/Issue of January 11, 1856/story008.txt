 This Convention, composed of delegates fromthe different Counties throughout the State, appointedto meet at Sacramento, on Tuesday, Nov.20th, 1855. for the purpose of devising ways andmeans to elevate their present social and politicalcondition, &., met according to appointment yesterday,at 10 A.M., in the church on Seventhstreet, near H street. Mr. Jacob Francis, of San Francisco, was calledto the Chair, and Mr. Vanneil appointed Secretary. On motion of Mr. Townsend, of San Francisco,a committee of five was appointed to examine thecredentials of delegates. The committee reported that they had examinedthe credentials of delegates from the differentcounties, and found the fallowing to be correct: From Ed Dorado County these were present 10members; Coloma, 2; Sacramento, 10; Yuba, 2;San Francisco, 10; Contra Costa. 1: Santa Clara,1; Nevada, 3; San Joaquin, 1; Siena, 1. Wholenumber of delegates, 47. Rev. Mr. Moon, of San Francisco—The subjectupon which we an about to deliberate is one whichinterests all classes—interests both races; and Ido sincerely trust that, keeping in view its greatimportance, we may put aside all lesser considerations—all party, all personal piques and preferences—giving ourselves up earnestly as men to itsaccomplishment. Do not let us disgrace ourselves—do not let those who deny us the possession ofintellect and soul have so great a triumph as tosee us meeting thus for a noble purpose, and failing,because we cannot govern our passions. Letus rather prove to them that we have all the and energy necessary to complete as well asthe brain to plan a work of moral regeneration.We are Americans—colored Yankees—and who boastproud of the soil of America as those who boastloudest of their love.  Mr. Yates—I will say to this Convention, in thelanguage of a celebrated divine, who, in a prayerbefore the early Congress of the States, in thestormy days of Revolution, prayed for unity amongthe people, and that, 'while they were many asthe waves, they might be one as the sea.' We areto know but one purpose, act together for the attainmentof one object. While I acknowledge that in form, appearanceand education, the African cannot compote withthe Caucasian race, yet his sympathies are anwarm and his feelings as humane. Ha can begrateful for kindness shown, and is as ready toforgive the injuries done him—he loves his countryas clearly as they. I was raised and educatedby the white man, and I thank the hand thatreared me. I love the soil that  me: sodo we all; and if we seek for patriotism and loveof country. where should it be found stronger orwarmer than in our own become?  Mr. Wilson, of Sacramento—No gentleman mustfeel insulted if I, or any other of our fellow-members,happen to express a different opinionfrom his own, in a manner which, to his cold, unimpassionedsoul, may seem unduly earnest andexcited. Men are differently constituted, andwhite some seem scarcely moved by the mightiestsubjects, others will feel an intense excitementupon subjects the most trivial. The same Godthat made a diversity of colors, hues, kinds andconditions, has seen proper to make minds of different orders and divers temperaments.  [Mr. Ward made some very sensible remarksconcerning the relative conditions of the whiteand colored races, and ended by saying;] 'The great  against which we arestruggling in local prejudice. Let us bring upthe  of reason, truth and justice, andshow the world the injustice of its prejudice andthe falsehood of its of repeated must that we arebut a something link between the monkey and theman. Let us prove to the world that we have and ambitions for the enjoyment of a more elevated sphere then that in which wehave so long gravellled.'     Mr.  of  being called, said;'I am no , but I cannot for hour heartfelt interest in the work beforeus. On hearing that there was to be a Convention ofColored  hold in this city, my  wasglad, for I  that it was to be the  stop in of improvement; and perhaps noother subject is coming so much interest inthe  on the efforts which the colored is making for its advancement and socialelevation.            white man's fact be firmly planted there, thanlooking over his shoulder he will  the blackman. Like his shadow, by his side.                      The Committee to nominate officers reported thefollowing named persons to acts as officers of thisConvention: President—William H. Yates, of San Francisco. President Vice Presidents—J. Small wood, of El Dorado;Danie Carter, of Nevada; Fielding Smithen, ofContra Costa; and Albert Vanneil, of Sierra. Vice Presidents Secretaries-Jeremiah Sanderson, of Sacramento;John H. Morris, of Tuolumne: and Frederick Barbados,of Contra Costa. Secretaries Chaplain—Rev. J.J. Moore. Chaplain On motion, a committee of two was appointed towait upon Mr. Yates, and conduct him to theChair, who, upon assuming the position, delivereda very interesting and eloquent address. Ha advisedthat the proceedings of the meeting be suchas to reflect honor upon themselves and the gloriouscountry that gave them birth. 'If there arefeelings of liberty,' said he 'within the breasts ofthose present, who but the Caucasian race taughtit to them! We love the soil that gave us life, andthe country we call our home. Though we arewronged, we delight to call it mother.' At the suggestion of the Rev. Mr. Stokes, an articlewas read from the Grass Valley Telegraph,advocating a liberal policy to be pursued towardsthe colored people. Telegraph It was read amid considerable applause; and amotion was made to return a vote of thanks to theeditor of the Telegraph for his independence in thematter, and after considerable discussion upon thepropriety of so doing, it passed by a decided vote. Telegraph The Evening Journal of San Francisco was alsoincluded in the vote of thanks. Evening Journal Mr. Newby, Chairman of the Business Committee,reported a preamble and resolutions, settingforth the wants of the colored people of this State,which report was received. A motion was made to adopt the report of theBusiness Committee, which was opposed by Mr.Townsend, as it contained matter he could not subscribeto. Mr. Townsend said the preamble was crouchingin its present form. All he wanted was to presenta manly, courteous, and dignified appeal to theLegislature to great them what is simply just intheir opinion. He believed by so doing they couldcommand the respect of their white brethren. Mr. Lewis endorsed the views of the last speaker. Mr. Newby said it was much easier generally tofind fault than commend—and the objections expressedby Mr. Townsend were to him about asclear as med. All the preamble expressed wastrue, and simple to understand. He had not, indrawing it up, drawn largely upon Roman or Grecianhistory to illustrate is by quotations that areto be found in every school book, but it merelystated what was known to every man in the State.A case in point occurred last weak in the UnitedStates Court in San Francisco. A man was triedfor murder on the high sea: the only witness in thecase was a Negro, and the Court decided that hisevidence could not be received, and the man wasliberated, thus inflicting; a great wrong upon whitemen by permitting a criminal to go at large, becausehe killed a man in presence of a negro, insteadof a white man. This, he considered, wasmore of a wrong to the whiten than to them. Mr. Townsend said it was too late in the day toappeal to the prejudices of the people. It was theduty and right of the Convention to amend  rejectthe report of the Committee, if deemed .He was in favor of telling the people of California,in the simplest manner, whether it be in Grecianor Roman quotations, what they desired of them,and thought the Committee should not object tothe adoption of anything that would beet conveytheir desires.   Mr. Newby said: We are an oppressed race, andare subject to strong prejudice, which we are nowseeking to overcome. When appealing to our oppressors,we want to do so in a manner that willhave weight. The legislature that passed the act,doubtless acted—or a portion of them—from anhonest principle, and he believed that they actedfrom what they believed to be a sense of duty.—He said the colored people were generally impoliticin all their actions in public matters, and ofteninjured their own acts. On motion, the whole matter under discussionwas laid on the table. Mr. Stokes: While, as a people, we are strivingfor our own advancement, and endeavoring to obtaina recognition in society as men, let , inthe selfishness of our own plane, loss sight of otherthings equally one duty. Look abroad the varied  of this  country, and not see on them  in top and in the valley, evilsexisting among our kind!  stalking in the Monday,and no head put forth to stop its progress?Let us first correct ourselves, and become worthyof respect, then the world will not hold its .One thing I have observed amongst our race, thatwhile all are , very few are .We see through this State very few colored formersor mechanics or ; yet it can be provedwe may become as  in these branches noother people. Still, there in no awakening to theimportance of proving ourselves capable of conductingthe affairs of business with still and advantage.In this State there was over three and ahalf millions of property owned by the color station; from this  hundred thousand dollarsof ten  been missingclaims valued at  per —we have everyadvantage for  whatever talent wemen among our own people—men who bought andsold by thousands. We must exert ourselves toaccomplish something here. There is plenty ofland for us to cultivate, but we must not delay,for the next year there will ome to thse Pacifichor thousands of men from the old world, andevery vacant acre will be taken.                                                        Mr. Stokes proceeded at some length to urge uponhis brethren the advantages of immediate action,&, and was followed by Mr. Lewis, whold: One of the most important things for ourpresent consideration is to obtain the right tobe heard upon oath in the courts of justice—this isthe one thing needful. As it is, the law is to usa dead letter, a broken staff to lean upon. Theoath that should protect life, liberty, and property,all that should throw the shield of law aroundourselves and families, is denied us. Now we haveno protection, and stand as nothing. The oathwould make people careful how they act before us.We should then have a voice. As it is, we arescarcely recognized as human beings.  Mr. Rggles; It is an injury to the white manas well an to ourselves, to deny us the right of beingheard under oath. Justice is often checkedin her course, and the guilty are suffered to escapebecause the only witnesses to their guilt are thoseupon whom the law has cast the stigma of beingunworthy to be heard.  The Committee on Business reported the followingpreamble and resolutions, as the result of theirlabors: Whereas, We, the colored people of the State of California,believing that the 14th section of the "Statuteconcerning crimes and punishments,' prohibiting ourtestimony for or against any white person, to be unjustin itself, and oppressive to every class of the community;and whereas, we believe that the institution ofcareful inquiries into our social, moral, religions, intellectualand financial condition, will demonstrate thatas a class—(making proper allowances for the disabilitiesunder which we labor)—we compare favorablywith any class in the community. And whereas, We believe that this section was intendedto protect white persons from a class, whose supposedsocial and intellectual condition was such as to justifythe prohibition of its testimony; sod whereas, webelieve that an appeal to the Legislature, to convene inJanuary, will meet with a favorable response from thathonorable body, believing, as we do, that the abovementioned section cannot be maintained on the groundof policy or expediency— Resolved, That the laws of evidence in judicial investigationshould be accommodated to, and be identifiedwith, the laws of the human mind; and that, therefore,every fact and circumstance, from whatever source itmay come, having a tendency to throw light or inducehuman belief upon the subject under investigation,should be viewed, heard, and judged of, according totheir relative weight and value, and of all the circumstancesof credit or discredit connected with them. Resolved, That past experience has abundantly shownthat all attempts to establish artificial standards of credibility,depending on such tests as race, color, creed, orcountry, are as unwise as they are unjust; that theyserve only on the one side, to obstruct the investigationof truth by the erection of useless barriers, and on theother to defraud the excluded classes, while at the sametime they subject them, in their lives, in their persons,and in their property, to outrage and injustice withimpunity, from more favored clauses. Resolved, That to a claw of people the right of testimonyis as valuable as the right of self-defence; arightwhich no generous foe will deny even to an enemy. Resolved, That the true and only tests of credibilityin a witness are his intelligence, integrity, sod his disinterestedness;that, as a race, we are willing to be subjectto these tests, to be applied in each case as it occurs,and that we ought not to be subject to any other. Resolved, That the reception of testimony, and itsbelief afterwards, are separate and distinct questions;and that after the first has been received, its credibilityremains to be judged of; and all the circumstances ofcredit or discredit attached to a witness, with the advantagewhen it has been received, that if it is right tobe believed, it has not been lost, and if it ought not tobe believed, its reception will not give it credit. reception Resolved, That all classes, without distinction, areinterested in the removal of all barriers as witnessesimposed upon the African race in California, as unwise,unnecessary for the protection of the white race, andunjust towards the proscribed classes, 'as taking thatwhich nought enriches it, but leaves them poor indeed;that these classes, in the consciousness of the injusticedone them in this respect, say with the old Grecian—'Strike, but hear.' Resolved, That we memorialize the Legislature at itsapproaching session, to repeal the third and fourth paragraphsof section three hundred and ninety-four of anAct passed April 29th, 1851, entitled, 'An Act to regulateproceedings in civil cases in the courts of justice ofthis State,' and also for the repeal of section fourteen ofan Act entitled, 'An Act concerning Crimes and Punishments,'passed April 16th, 1850. Resolved, That a Committee be appointed with fullpowers to adopt such measures as may be deemed expedientto accomplish the object in view. Resolved, That we recommend the organization of aGrand Association, with auxiliaries in every county, forthe purpose of collecting statistical and other evidencesof our advancement and prosperity; also to encourageeducation, and a correct and proper deportment in ourrelations towards our white fellow-citizens, and to eachother. Resolved, That we regret and reprobate the apathyand timidity of a portion of our people, in refusing totake part in any public demonstration, having for itsobject the removal of political and other disabilities, byjudicious and conservative action. Resolved, That we recommend the creation of a contingentfund of $10,000, five thousand dollars to be controlledby a committee, having discretionary powers toenable us to carry forward any measure that has for itsobject the amelioration of our condition. On motion of Mr. Anderson, the report of thecommittee was received and adopted by acclamation,amidst much applause. Mr. Anderson commenced to read a series ofresolutions referring to the action of n NationalConvention of colored people assembled in Philadelphiarecently, but he was ruled out of orderby the President, who declared that while he presidedover the deliberations of the Convention, noextraneous subjects should be brought forward todisturb the harmony of its proceedings. They hadassembled for one object only, and the Conventionshould not swerve from it to debate the expediencyof the actions of men in Philadelphia, Boston,or Charleston. The Chair was sustained by acclamation. Mr. Newby offered a resolution, which was passed,tendering the thanks of the Convention to theeditors and reporters of the State Tribune, StateJournal, and Union, for the fair and just reports ofthe proceedings of the Convention. State Tribune, StateJournal Union Mr. Booth offered a resolution, which was adopted,providing for the appointment of a Committeeto inquire into the mineral possessions and agriculturalinterests of the colored people of this State. On motion, a State Central Committee of oneeach from twenty-three Counties is the State wasappointed to raise means to carry out the objectsin view, and to atition in relation to thecondition—moral, social, pecuniary, etc.,—of thecolored people.   On motion of Rev. Mr. Moore, a Committee oftwo was appointed to present an address to the coloredpeople of this State, in relation to the properexertions to be used to secure to colored children asuitable education. Rev. Messrs. Moore and Wardwere appointed said Committee. Mr. Newby rd a form for the petitions whichwere to be circulated for  to be prtutedto the Legislature,  was adopted.     On motion of Mr. Tond, a State ExecutiveCommittee, consisting of ten persons, who shall at San Francisco, Sacraments and Marysville,was appointed to be the medium through whichtheir petition shall be presented to the Legislature.   Mr. Towd, of the Committee to inquire intothe state and condition of the colored populationof the State of California, made the following.  Table  Table  vested in several branches of business, real estate,mining, etc.: but agriculture is the most premi-nent.They also beg leave to state, that the coloredresidents of California are, in proportion totheir numbers, the least recipients of public charity,which they regard as clear proof of their capacityto take care of their families for the present,and to provide for their future.   Mr. Hardy: I beg leave to call the attention ofthe House to the fact, that too amount, — illions,set down by the Committee as the probablewealth of the colored population of this State, isin addition to immense same which have been,from time to time, paid to their owners by coloredmen who have come here as slaves, and who, by acourse of honest industry, have paid for and obtainedtheir freedom. I adduce this as anotherevidence of the enterprise and capability of ourrace.  Rev. J. Moore: There is an expression in thereport which I think should he corrected. It isthis: 'That we are entirely destitute of any protection,in person and property, by the laws of theland.' This is incorrect, in some degree. Andwhile we are stating our grievances, lot us endeavorto do so in a spirit of thankfulness for all thefavors shown us, and acknowledge every obligationwe are under; but, above all, let us do sowith truth. I, therefore, move an amendment tothe report, so that it may rend thus: 'That wedo not receive full protection of the law in commonwith the white man.' Mr. Townsend: I deny that the pitiful supportwhich the law offers can be called a protection. Arewe heard before the bar of justice? Are we recognizedas having souls, and comprehending thenature and responsibility of an oath? "Ti but afew months since a negro was stabbed in the streetsof San Francisco, in the presence of twenty witnesses.The murderer was a Spanish man: he wasarrested, and discharged on bail. On the day ofhis trial, his counsel ridiculed the idea of his beingpunished, and said he had 'only killed a nigger,who attempted to strike him down.' What wasthe result? The murderer was cleared, and in afew hours was walking the streets openly! Thereis, indeed, a semblance of protection, but it is notreal. protection.  only killed a nigger Mr. Stokes: I have listened to the report asread, and believe it to be true in every particular.If I have a claim of $100 against a white man,and bring an action for its recovery at law, unlessI have a white man who possesses the moral courageto come forward and endure the odium of amisconstructed society, and testify in my behalf,I lose my suit, and am scarce exempt from the indignityof being kicked out of court. If a man cannot swear to a plain, honest, simpleaccount, where is the protection of law?There is none! 'tis but a shadow and a name. Mr. Ward offered a resolution, urging the necessityof the colored people to become temperancemen. He said, in offering it, he did not expectthe support of gentlemen who were in the habit ofwashing down the cotton in their throats everymorning with a cock-tail, but they saw daily toomuch evidence of the evils of intemperance not toact upon the matter in some way. The Chair, though a warm supporter of the proportionof Mr. Ward, considered it out of order,as the Convention had decided to keep out all extraneousmatter, and upon that ground they haddeclined to act upon the school question. Thetemperance question is extraneous matter, andmust be led out; but the Convention could appealfrom his decision, if they desired to, and heshould not deem it discourteous to him if he wasoverruled.  Mr. Collins moved the rules be suspended, andthe resolution was adopted. The Chair, by leave, reversed his decision, andthe Convention refused to suspend the rules bythe following vote: Ayes, 20; Nays, 17. Two-thirdsbeing required to suspend, the motion waslost. The following is the resolution of Mr. Ward: Whereas, we regard the sin of intemperance tobe a crying evil—a public calamity—a check tothe religious, social, mental and financial advancementof the colored people of this State; therefore, Resolved, That we recommend to our people theconcentration of every moral and intellactual forcefor the complete removal of this dire curse fromamongst us. The Chair here requested Rev. Mr. Stokes toseat himself on an opposite side of the room, aswhile two preachers were seated together, he nevercould keep order. The request was complied with,amid much laughter. Mr. McDougall offered a resolution to establisha banking house by colored men. Mr. Morris was opposed to any such movementon the part of colored men, and did not think sucha banking house ought to be established. Mr. McDougall thought there were many menin the State, who would not deposit their moneywith the bunking houses at present established,and by so doing, much more money would he putin circulation; but as it met with decided opposition,he would withdraw, which be did. A motion to send a report of the proceedings tothe Boston Liberator, and Frederick Douglass Paper,was voted down. Liberator Frederick Douglass Paper Mr. New by offered a resolution, returningthanks to the President, W.H. Yates, for the ablemanner in which he had presided over the Convention.It was adopted by acclamation, and in respondingto it, Mr. H. remarked that he duly appreciatedthe high compliment conferred upon himby the members of the Convention in thus expressing,in so emphatic a manner, their thanks. Inpresiding over their deliberations, he had soughtto act fairly towards all, and if he had not doneso, ho exceedingly regretted it. One thing he desiredto call their attention to, particularly as hehad been spoken to by several gentlemen presentupon the subject. In the published report of a few remarks hemade on Tuesday, he was made to say, 'While Iacknowledge in form, appearance and education,the African cannot compete with the Caucasianrace.' &. It should have been, 'He is unable,under existing circumstances, to compete with theCaucasian race,' &. This is what he said andmeant, as he could not admit that the Africancould not compete with any nation, if he was allowedthe same opportunities. The colored peoplehave much to contend against in the presentage, but, by pursuing a proper course, could overcomemuch of it. He said: We must love our enemies,while we appeal to them for justice, andwhat we conceive to be right. The American heartis too noble and generous to turn a deaf ear toour requests, coached, as they are, in respectfulterms. We ask for no social concessions or privileges,but say, 'hands off,' and do not depressus; we only desire the removal of a special grievance.Whore does the white man go that the blackdoes not? If to the battle-field, in conqueringlands, the black is found at his side; If not witha sword, he has a soup-ladle to feed them whilethey fight. I believe this Convention has accomplishedmuch good, for it has awakened an interestin the minds of all, and much good must eventuallygrow out of it. I am  orator, but a simplecook and ward, and work hard and honestlyfor my daily living, yet have a love for libertywhich cannot be repressed, a it has grown in mefor years.    He closed by advising his colored brethren tolive honestly and harmoniously together, and conductthemselves in such a manner as will overcomethe prejudices against, them. His remarks werevery appropriate and well expressed, and, ofcourse, were received with much favor by the Convention. Mr. Phlpa, from the printing Committee, reportedin favor of establishing a newspaper in this to advance the cause of the colored people,and providing for the appointment of a Committeeof thse to rtain the probable cost, &., andto make their report as seen as possible to theState Committee.     The deleg from the various  then forward, and pledged the following to the ,000 contingent fund; San Francisco,$1000; , $500; , ; .
