 The New York Tribune in spasms about Dr.Holmes's oration before the New England Societythere, because the doctor doubted the wisdom ofrabid abolitionism. The abolitionists introducetheir views, and inculcate their notions, everywhere,in every manner, and on all occasions—innovels, in prose, in poetry, in sermons, in lectures,in orations—-indeed they cannot open their mouthswithout dropping a bit of 'nigger' which they areconstantly rolling, like a sweet morsel, under theirtongues. But a syllable on the other side throwsthem into hysterics at once, and they froth likechafed toads. The Tribune not only attempts tobe excruciatingly satirical upon the orator, but, ina Miss Nancy way, turns up the whites of its eyes,and rolls up its thick lips at the 'provincial' townof Boston. What mighty metropolis gave birth toHorace Greeley, or to any of the hundred and onenewspaper scavengers who empty their swill intothe enough of the Tribune? Then, again, Dr.Holmes in taunted with possessing but small capitalas a wit, and with being an anatomist! If thedoctor had no more wit than the Tribune has honesty,he would be declared insolvent immediately,unable to pay value received for a single smile.The Tribune had better draw in its woolly head,take its long heels out of the way, and crop itsearn, last its unseemly appearance invite the doctor'sinvestigation of its hybrid 'anatomy.' —BostonPost.

The old adage, 'Birds of a feather,'herein receives fresh confirmation.
