 There is just one act of the national executive,the performance of which would immediately setall matters right in Kansas. That is, the removalof Wilson Shannon from the Governorship of theterritory, and the appointment of a man like Readerin his place. In that case, by affording him themilitary aid, as well as the pecuniary resources ofthe general government, in support of the laws, accordingto the provisions of the Nebraska-KansasBill itself, the President might effectually put aninstant termination to all disturbances. The ruffianinvaders from Missouri, whose depredatory incursionsinto the territory have produced all thedifficulties there, would quail with terror, the momentthey saw the arm of the general governmentagainst them. It is only because their acts areconnived at and approved by the powers that he,that they persevere in the perpetration of such diabolicalschemes. The nomination of Shannon, it is understood, isnow before the senate for confirmation. Uponwhat principle any Northern man in that body canvote to confirm the appointment of such a scoundrel,for a position, the functions of which he hasso foully perverted, we are at a loss to conceive.Until the deed is consummated, we shall be unwillingto believe that a majority, even of so hunkerisha body as the Senate of the United States, canbe brought to sanction so infamous an act. Letthe name of Wilson Shannon, with the threats andoaths he has uttered against freedom, and law, andorder, in Kansas, and his secret machinations withAtchison and his Missouri ruffians, to subvert popularrights and 'popular sovereignty' in the territory,be thrown back in the face of the President,accompanied with the indignant score of everySenator, who sets any value anon official integrityand official honor. U Franklin Pierce can find nomore decent person than Wilson Shannon, to be hisagent and representative in Kansas, than lea thePresident repair there himself, and head the regimentsof the invading, ruffians in his own person.A pretty figure he might cut there, with Atchisonand String fellow for his aide, provided be wouldnot faint in the attempt to add to his military renownby any new display; of fonts of horsemanship,in his  foray against the right of actualsettlers in the territory to the undisturbed managementof their own affairs. faint
