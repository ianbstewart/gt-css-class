 Extract from the new and interesting volume, justpublished by John P. Jewett k Co., Boston, entitled'Glances end Glimpses; or, Fifty Years Social, includingTwenty Years Professional Life; by HarriotK. Hunt, M.D.' I have a purpose here, I cherish a hope to arousepublic thought respecting the position of our youngwomen after they have left school. Their parents—many of them— are in only moderate circumstances.They hare toiled early and late to procurethe education of their daughters; and, if theywere truly parents, they should desire to see someworthy result follow that education,—to see itpractically applied to the business of life. Alas!what is the truth on this subject? Girls are educated—for what? They are sedulously trained—for what? For nothing but marriage! They areearly taught to consider what are their chancesand attractions for the market! I say the market,—for I have no more scruple in applying this termto the state of society with regard to women, thanI have in applying it to the marts where any otherpurchasable article is bought and sold. In Circassia, they tell us, women are trained with a soleview to the piastres they shall bring when sold toa Turkish harem; and, what is worse, they are degradedto consider such training honorable. Icharge it on society that women are generally educatedwith a view to their future sale for wealth,social position, a home, or any other terms onwhich a dependent and ambitious, a weak andsilly woman, may be obtained; and as systematicallyas in the East, they are taught to believe thistraining reputable! Now I see no possible reasonwhy young women, unless they are absolutely neededin the domestic circle,—and even then, self-relianceshould be taught them,—should not betrained to some healthful, remunerative employment.To say nothing of its beneficial effects ontheir own character, or of the independent positionit would give them is society, such employmentwould often enable them to sustain their parentsby their own earnings,—when the chances andchanges of life have brought reverses to the home,and to gladden the declining years of those parentswith comforts, too often wanting now. Daughterswould then be capable of rendering assistance, aswell as sons. Within my own knowledge, fatherswith families of daughters lament the loss of ason because 'girls are so expensive!' Think ofit! This constant keeping back our sex from anearly, active participation in the duties of life, hasbeen the means of throwing upon many a fatherwith a family of daughters, a burden be was utterlyunable to bear. He has given them money, hardly earned by toilsomeand anxious hours—perhaps a creditor neededit;—but they must appear well at the party—they must make their market! Hard-working,kind-hearted, but injudicious mothers, are hidaway in the kitchen, that silly daughters may beflauntingly dressed in the parlor, thrumming tuneswithout a touch of melody, fur the entertainmentof Mr. Bombastes! How many of these cases arearound us! They are heartless deceptions, andoutrages on womanhood. Too many of these poorchildren marry, and return to their parents, brokenheartedthrough the failure of their husbands,(many of whom never had any thing to fail on,) orpenniless widows with children who sorrowfullyincrease their care in old age. Such heart-historiesappeal powerfully to our sympathies, while theyrouse our indignation at the degradation and uselessnessof our sex. I wish I could touch this subjectwith the pen of inspiration. I look aroundthe early home of my childhood, and my heartsickens; whole families nearly swept away by falseand perverted views! young, bright, promisingschool-girls, dwarfed into young ladies, and theflag hoisted that they are to he sold to the highestbidder! The matter is made still worse by theconditions of the sale; for sobriety, chastity, principle,character, are not required in the purchaser,—he only need have wealth, show, or bravado. Icould be personal here, and bring out harrowingcases; but let them pass. Let the reader glancearound his own neighborhood, and say whether Ispeak the truth or not. Go to Washington streetin Boston, go to the main street of any of our greatcities, and in the silly, coquettish, over-dressed,fashionable young ladies, promenading to and frofor the purpose of being seen, behold anotherphase of this abominable social marketing. Canhotel-life promote family growth! Can auctionsales of furniture, changed to suit the caprices offashion, and often at the expense of the poor mechanic,contribute to domestic happiness, or inculcatehabits of prudence and economy! Do they,not indicate an incapacity for borne duties,—amiasmatic indolence in those purchased wives!. This pernicious evil is to be charged on society.It is not, as many suppose, charging it on an intangibility.Is not society an aggregation of individuals!and is not this to be charged on thoseindividuals separately and collectively! May it,not be affirmed that the prevalent custom of educatingyoung women only for Marriage, and not forthe duties and responsibilities consequent on marriage—only for appendages and dead weights tohusbands—of bringing thorn up without an occupation,profession, or employment, and thus leavingthem dependent on anybody but themselves—is an,enormous evil, and an unpardonable sin! In thename of my sex, a protest should be issued againstthe fashionable education fathers and mothers givetheir daughters, encouraging them to acquire thosepeacock accomplishments, those shallow charms ofconversation, and those personal airs, manners,and graces which they are pleased to term 'attractionsin order that they may catch the fancy ofsame wealthy simpleton or arrant knave, and sowin a husband! It is educating their daughtersfor what is not marriage in any worthy sense ofthat word. Yes, their protest, earnest, solemn,touching, should he entered against the custom ofbringing up young women who are to become wivesand , without a knowledge of those domesticduties and responsibilities, which  can them to live true to those relations without themsolid intellectual attainments and spiritual graces,by which they are to educate their children andhallow the atmosphere of , and without them'attractions.'—enduring when youth and beautyare , which can alone win and keen for themthe respect and love of any sensible, upright, andnoble man, worthy the same of husband! Againstthe wrong done to young women, who may enter the carriage state, by giving them so .Occupation, or profession, and thus leaving them toIdleness, dependence, , and .Let every girl see to it that, she has the  ofher own support. The  for the evil of whichI have here spoken is  of every daughterand every parent. 'It is a  evil. It isone of the  which and and beneath its the happiness, and the comfort of whole are withered. You have the axe, and the root liesbare—strike courageously in faith, and a resurrectionwill follow. It must soon be seen that bringingup daughters for nothing but marriage, minglespoison in the cup of domestic life, in traitorous tothe virtue of both sexes, for neither suffers alone—is adverse to happiness, to the development ofconscience and to religion, and introduces to thedwellings of wretchedness and despair. The resultof this degradation is pride, intemperance,licentiousness—nay, every vice, misery, and degradation.When labor becomes honorable and elevating—when we realize that labor is the charm tostay this fend, and the pride from which it had itsorigin and sustenance, dies at the awakening ofthe sense of our relation to human kind, and ourresponsibility to God. Then will every woman prepareherself for useful occupation, and follow it.Then will man see that industrial avenues are opento women—that they can follow any business orprofession for which they are qualified, without beingexposed to contemptible insults which are heapedupon those who have independence enough tostep out of the beaten track.                  must There are women who have wealth, and whomay be supposed to have nothing to do with thissubject-occupation for woman. But it is not so.They have a great deal to do with it. Responsibilityrests on them, as on every one. Wealth hasnever given happiness, except through its use. Themoment luxury is its use, that moment diseases ofmind and body lay hands on their victims. Howcan the physique be braced, if no fresh breath fromthe outer world is suffered to permeate the languid,enervating air of the drawing-room? How can thegrasp of the mind be vigorous, without action?Daughters of inherited wealth, or accumulatedlabor! the wide door of philanthropy is open peculiarlyto you! Your life-work lies beyond yourthreshold: your wealth has placed you above thesorrowful struggle for daily bread which takes upthe whole time of so many of your brothers andyour sisters. You are the almoners of God. Adouble accountability is yours. There are sufferingsaround you which you can alleviate or remove.There are heavy burdens which you can lighten.There is ignorance which you can illumine. Thereare the poor who look to you for solace and for aid. Wealth hasnever given happiness, except through its use. you! You are liberally endowed; are you to use thesegifts and powers for those only, who have had thesame advantages as yourselves! No! If you canfind nothing else to do, let each of you find outsome child, poor in purse, but rich in soul, as allchildren are before the world makes them bankrupt;and with a holy and generous self-denial, lay asidea certain sum of money each mouth, for that child'sculture. Educate-carry that child forward! Ultimateyour life in that child. Bring philosophyto your investigation of the mystery of existence;it will show you, at least, that it is impossible foryou to enjoy physical health and spiritual life, ifyou pass your time in sleeping, eating, drinking,dressing, reading, flirting, or any tiling that is onlyfor your own gratification. Nor will these occupationsprepare you for the life to come. If you arenot wholly insensible, you will thank me for thesehints;—use them! Your duty is to minister to thesorrows, the privations, the wants, and the needsaround you. Show the world that there are FlorenceNightingales for the sad army of the sufferingand the poor! Make it your life-work 'to attendto the neglected, and to remember the forgotten!'Money! money! Rely upon that for happiness?Possession adds to your responsibilities, if you lookat it rightly. It elevates you—it gives your lifedignity and nobleness, if you use it as a trust!Used otherwise, it is useless. A fixed purpose inthe mind of every young woman, rich and poor,when entering on the theatre of life, would openthe mind to an understanding of the Divine Word—'Lead us not into temptation'—for idleness isthe greatest temptation to selfishness, and selfishnessis the ruin of the individual, and the cause ofthree fourths of the misery in the world.
