 The Slave Oligarchy, composed of Southernmembers and Northern adherents of the slaveholdingcasts, have everything their own way. Of twenty-six chairman, sixteen own slaveholders,and seven, slaveholding adherents. Of thethree ,  if anti-slavery, Allen isa , James, uncertain. In a word, wrongthe chairman of the twenty-six standing committees,the views and interests of the free States inrelation to slavery, comprising as they do, morethan two-thirds of the free populations of the country,are represented by a  man!     This is what they call—Nationality! The Oligarchy has when special pains to the most important committees. For example;Mason, author of the Fugitive Slave Bill in chairmanof the Committees on Foreign Relations, backed                          Maine, Bell and Hale, of New Hampshire, Factsand Collamer, of Vermont, Sumner and Wilson, ofMassachusetts, Foster, of Connecticut, Steward, ofNew York, Wade, of Ohio, Trumbull, of IllinoisDurkee, of Wisconsin, Harlan, of Iowa. Some ofthem an veteran statesmen, all men of decided abilities,capable of rendering the moat important servicesin the work of legislation. In fact, it wouldbe difficult to select any other fourteen men of theSenate equal to them in aggregate talent.    Now, let us see where 'Nationality' has put them.Mr. Seward stands third in the Committee on Commercenext to last in the Committee on Pensions, thelast being reserved for Mr. Sumner whose name appearson no other Committee; while Mr. Stuartof Michigan, is chairman of one important Committee,and a member of three others! Harlan,Trumbull, and Wilson are stowed away in theCommittee on Manufactures, of no kind of importance.Wade foots up the useless on Agriculture.Bell stands third on the Committee on the Militia,not very dangerous to the Commonwealth; Fosterthird on Private Land Claims. In a word, generally,where than in some drudgery of details, withlittle honor, and no influence on general interestsor politics, there you will find the places of the Republicans. So much for 'Nationality,'—the 'Nationality'so highly prized by the Hunts and Hilliard's of theNorth—a 'Nationality' whose essential element,whose beginning and end is, devotion to slavery. devotion to slavery.
