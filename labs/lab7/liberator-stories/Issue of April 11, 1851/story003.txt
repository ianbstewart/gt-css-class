 The city authorities of Boston have given evidencetheir desire to have the laws universally enforced,issuing an ordinance making it the special dutythe City Marshal, with the police at his command,obey the requesition of the U.S. Marshal, and lendhand to the maintenance of law and the executionin a legal process. This is a prompt official recognition of the obligationto sustain and enforce the law; and comingimmediately after the manifestation of mob powerof rescue of a fugitive slave from the custody oflaw, affords cheering assurance that the aid ofprinicipal authorities of the city will be gives,another time, promptly to the support of order every species of interception. The reputationof city has badly been damaged heretofore by the afforded to noisy and a editions percentagesin interrupting the course of justice, and obstructingby violence the due administration of law. It secondsome such emphatic and official recognition asthis, of the obligations of duty in the active supportof the law, to be followed on the first occasion byactive measures in order to restore, in the publicmind elsewhere, a faith in the loyalty of Boston tothe Constitution of the United States, and its respectfor the rights guarantied by that instrument.   For the loss of property to the claimant, in thiscase, the law provides a mode of indemnification. Ifthe fugitive be returned, the mob will have been foiledin its male object, and the course of events thereafter will show how far the zeal, newly professed,for the main stance of the law, is sincere, and willbe exhibited in acts. For our own part, we are inclined to believe thatthe occurrence of this outbreak, partial as it hasbeen, may have a wholesome influence in startlingthe Boston authorities and the quiet and respectablemants of the citisens from their apathy, and impressingthem with the absolute necessity of beingvigilant and well prepared against the recurrence ofany more such disgraceful scenes.
