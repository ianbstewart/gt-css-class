 At the close of the examination of the persons arrestedon the honorable charge of having assisted inthe rescue of SHADRACH from the clutches of the kidnappers,Patrick Riley and his crew, in Boston, BENJAMINF.HALLETT, the U.S. Bloodhound Commissioneraddressed the U.S. Attorney, the notoriousGEORGE LUNT, as follows:— HADRACH ENJAMIN ALLETT EORGE UNT Mr. Attorney— These laborious investigations,which have occupied some twenty days in thiscourt-room, are now brought to a close, and here myduties terminate. A still more arduous service willbe required of you in the conduct of the cases thatwill pass to a higher tribunal, and which, I doubtnot will be rendered with the firmness and abilitywith which the duties of the prosecution have beendischarged in these preliminary examinations. Sevenof the parties arranged have been held for trial, onehas been discharged upon a hearing, and two uponyour motion for cause. Under the circumstancesconnected with these arrests, the importance of securingthe parties implicated before they should removebeyond the reach of process, and the difficultyof finding the witness and ascertaining fully the natureof the testimony, until brought to the test of examinationunder oath, I think it due to the conductof the prosecution to hear my testimony to thesound discretion and active efficiency with whichwe several cases have been prepared and the truthexecuted. The parties have all been defended withstudy and zeal,— and if the examinations havebeen protracted, it has arisen from a desire to give afull and fair hearing to the defence, so that all matterspresent to the issue might be fully broughtout, and the decision in each case carefully and deliberatelyformed. A crime so daring and so unknown before as therescue of a party lawfully held under arrest, by theforcible entry into a court-room, by a mob of rioters,some of them armed with dangerous weapons, atmid-day, and in the midst of this populous city; indicatinga combination and conspiracy of no inconsiderableextent to resist the laws by violence, dependedthe most prompt and energetic action invindication of the public peace and the supremacyof the laws. And though but a few of the large numbershown by these investigations to have beenactively engaged in, or secretly inciting to this outragehave thus far, been detected, and the mostguilty, at least morally, army escape leaving their instrumentsto suffer the penalty of the overt acts theyhave incited; yet we may hope that what has beenand will be done, will give ample assurance to thepublic, and warning to all offenders in like cases,that such lawless acts cannot go unpunished. Thesecases have a much higher bearing than mere individualacts of lawlessness, because they are the manifestresult of a combination to resist the laws, andto prevent their enforcement in all like cases. Inthis view, it concerns both the State and the Union,because successful forcible resistance to any law into operation, and its prostration by combinationsand violence, tend directly to the overthrow of alllaw, and the insecurity of all the rights and immunitieswhich every citizens holds, and can only hold,under the general protection of the Constitution andlaws of the land. The reelection cannot fail to carry with it a salutaryaudience upon the public mind; a result whichhas been made apparent in the progress of theseinvestigations. Whatever may have been the explanationor the purpose,— as in the commencementof these hearings was somewhat manifest,— to embarassor divert their legitimate object; or by appearsto a supposed sympathy for offenders, (whetherprincipals or instruments,) to transform a crime intoa virtue, a law-breaker into a philanthropic martyr,—it has calmly subsided into the uniform and undisturbedcourse of justice. We have another securityagainst a like occurrence, in the fact that a sense ofduty, which is imposed on every good citizens, has operatedin this, as it usually does in all cases of a systematicand combined violation of law, to bring forwardwitnesses to testify to material facts incidentallycoming within their knowledge. And we maynow well believe, that if heretofore each appeals, tendingto incite the reckless and unthinking to acts ofoutrage, or if a mistaken notion of imaginary allegianceto any law of self-will or individual constructions,higher than our obligations under the constitutionand the laws of the land, have prevailed to anyconsiderable extent among us, they will either causeto act, or, if continued, will find no instruments togive them the form of physical force, and will besufficiently counteracted by a determined public sentimentand an efficient administration of justice, thatwill rigidly discriminate between the right of freediscusion to change existing laws, and the wrong oflawless violence to resist them. On the other hand, if there be an honest sympathytoward a particular class of persons, brought withinthe operation of law, it can readily find a legitimateexpression in another and far more beneficial formthan secret conspiracies or open resistance to defeatlaw. In the cause we have had before us, a practicalpeople like the people of New England, howeverexcitable on some subjects, might well reflect thatthe labor and actual expenditures necessarily causedby the recent outrage in our streets and court rooms,and which must be uncared in another tribunal elsewherebefore these cases are finally disposed of,would have furnished means probably sufficient tobelieve, lawfully, and in the exercise of a creditablephilanthropy, every individual case sickly to haverisen, if the law had been left to take its undisturbedcourse in the hands of its officers and counselors,and, at the some time, we should have been sparedall that great injury and discredit which may havethen indicted by the indiscretions and outrages ofthe few, upon this whole community and this Commonwealth,in their commercial and political relations,to the master States of the Union. All the matters presented to the Commissioner been disposed of, it only remains for me toscourn this court without delay, and it is adjournedaccordingly.
