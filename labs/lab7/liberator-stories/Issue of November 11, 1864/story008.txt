 MARYLAND A FREE STATE. The importance ofthis glorious act to Maryland, and to the nation, canscarcely be estimated. ARYLAND A REE TATE. At a meeting of Marylanders in New York lastweek, to exchange congratulations upon the abolitionof slavery in their State, Dr. Snodgrass gave an interestingstatement, showing how the pro-slaveryparty had bound, hand and foot, the people of Mary-land,under the old Constitution of the State. Hesaid: "When the question was asked, why the subjectof emancipation in Maryland was not left to the legislature,we answered, because the old Constitution forbadethat course, by declaring that under no circumstancesshould the legislature touch 'the relation betweenmaster and slave.' Once the legislature hadthe power to act on the question, and to do as theythought best, provided two-thirds of both branchesthereof should concur, and the next legislature, assemblingtwo years thereafter, should happen to confirm,their enactments by a like majority of two-thirds.But this privilege was snatched from the people's representativesby the inexorable slave interest, throughthe next Constitution—that is, the one just superseded—inwhich the clause, totally prohibiting legislationon the subject, was inserted as an insurmountablebarrier, as it was hoped, to the progress of freeprinciples. But, most unfortunately for the slaveholdinginterest, it was not far seeing enough, afterall. It permitted a provision to be inserted, whichopened the way for the legislature to submit to the peoplethe question of ordering a new Constitution, atstated period—every ten years."
