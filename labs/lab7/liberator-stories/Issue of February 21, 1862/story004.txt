Resolutions declaratory of the relations between the UnitedStates and the territory once occupied by certain States,and now usurped by pretended Governments, without constitutionalor legal right. Whereas certain States, rightfully belonging tothe Union of the United States, have through theirrespective Governments wickedly undertaken to abjureall those duties by which their connection withthe Union was maintained; to renounce all allegianceto the Constitution; to levy war upon theNational Government; and, for the consummationof this treason, have unconstitutionally and unlawfullyconfederated together, with the declared purposeof putting an end by force to the supremacy ofthe Constitution within their respective limits; andwhereas this condition of insurrection, organized bypretended governments, openly exists in South Carolina,Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Virginia,except in Eastern Tennessee and Western Virginia,and has been declared by the President of the UnitedStates, in a proclamation duly made in conformitywith an act of Congress, to exist throughout thisterritory, with the exceptions already named; andwhereas the extensive territory thus usurped by thesepretended Governments, and organized into a hostileconfederation, belongs to the United States as anin the present and future generations, and is socompletely interlinked with the Union that itis forever dependent thereupon; and whereas theConstitution, which is the supreme law of theland, cannot be displaced in its rightful operationwithin this territory, but must ever continue the supremelaw thereof, notwithstanding the doings ofany pretended governments acting singly or in confederation,federation, in order to put an end to its supremacy;therefore, 1. Resolved, That any vote of secession or otheract by which any State may undertake to put anend to the supremacy of the Constitution within itsterritory is inoperative and void against the Constitution,and when sustained by force it becomes apractical abdication by the State of all rights underthe Constitution, while the treason which it involvesstill further works an instant forfeiture of all thosefunctions and powers essential to the continued existenceof the State as a body politic, so that fromthat time forward the territory falls finder the exclusivejurisdiction of Congress as other territory, andthe State being, according to the language of thelaw, felo-de-se, ceases to exist. abdication forfeiture felo-de-se 2. Resolved, That any combination, of men assumingto act in the place of such State, and attemptingto ensnare or coerce the inhabitants thereofinto a confederation hostile to the Union, is rebellious,treasonable, and destitute of all moral authority;and that such combination is a usurpation, incapableof any constitutional existence, and utterlylawless, so that everything dependent upon it iswithout constitutional or legal support. 3. Resolved, That the termination of a State underthe Constitution necessarily causes the terminationof those peculiar local institutions which, havingno origin in the Constitution or in those naturalrights which exist independent of the Constitution,are upheld by the sole and exclusive authority ofthe State. 4. Resolved, That slavery being a peculiar localinstitution, derived from local laws, without any originin the Constitution or in natural rights, is upheldby the sole and exclusive authority of the State, andmust therefore cease to exist legally or constitutionallywhen the State on which it depends no longerexists; for the incident cannot survive the principal. 5. Resolved, That in the exercise of its exclusivejurisdiction over the territory once occupied bythe States, it is the duty of Congress to see that thesupremacy of the Constitution is maintained in itsessential principles, so that everywhere in this extensiveterritory slavery shall cease to exist practically,as it has already ceased to exist constitutionallyor legally. 6. Resolved, That any recognition of slavery insuch territory, or any surrender of slaves under thepretended laws of the extinct States by any officerof the United States, civil or military, is a recognitionof the pretended governments, to the exclusionof the jurisdiction of Congress under the Constitution,and is in the nature of aid and comfort to therebellion that has been organized. 7. Resolved, That any such recognition of slaveryor surrender of pretended slaves, besides being arecognition of the pretended governments, givingthem aid and comfort, is a denial of the rights ofpersons who, by the extinction of the States, havebecome free, so that, under the Constitution, theycannot again be enslaved. 8. Resolved, That allegiance from the inhabitantand protection from use Government are correspondingobligations, dependent upon each other, sothat while the allegiance of every inhabitant of thisterritory, without distinction of color or class, is dueto the United States, and cannot in any war be defeatedby the action of any pretended government,or by any pretence of property or claim to service,the corresponding obligation of protection is at thesame time doe by the United States to every suchinhabitant, without distinction of color or class; andit follows that inhabitants held as slaves, whose paramountallegiance is due to the United States, mayjustly look, to the National Government for protection. 9. Resolved, That the duty directly east uponCongress by the extinction of the States is reinforcedby the positive prohibition of the Constitution, that"no State shall enter into nay confederation," or"without the consent of Congress keep troops orships-of-war in times of peace, or enter into anyagreement or compact with another State," or"grant letters of marque and reprisal," or "coinmoney," or "emit bills of credit," or "without theconsent of Congress lay any duties on exports or imports,"all of which has been dose by these pretendedgovernments, and also by the positive injunctionof the Constitution, addressed to the nation, that"the United States shall guarantee to every Statein this Union a republican form of government;"and that in pursuance of this duty cast upon Congress,and further enjoined by the Constitution,Congress will consume complete jurisdiction of suchvacated territory where such unconstitutional andillegal things have been attempted, and will proceedto establish therein republican forms of governmentunder the Constitution; and in the execution of thistrust will provide carefully for the protection of allthe inhabitants thereof, for the security of families,the organization of labor, the encouragement of industry,and the welfare of society, and will in everyway discharge the duties of a just, merciful and paternalgovernment.
