 George W. Thompson, the intermeddling BritishAbolitionist, who, several years ago, visited thiscountry, and boldly advocated disunion, had a receptionat Cooper Institute, New York, last night.General John C. Fremont was to preside, and, wepresume, did so. The New York Tribune, speakingon the subject, says:— Tribune "There are prejudices against Mr. Thompson amongour people, growing nut of the fact that he was amongus thirty years ago, when 'Liberty and Union' werenot 'one and inseparable;' and he stood sternly farLiberty. 'The Union' being a Shibboleth of oppression,he repudiated the giant wrong and all its hiding-places.But, from the hour when slavery sought the life ofoar country, ha has been that country's untiring andmoat efficient champion." The Union' being a Shibboleth of oppression The Tribune's sneer at the Union "as having beena Shibboleth of oppression'' is one in which that paperdoes not indulge alone. Every rebel in theSouth—every pro-slavery man in the land utters thesame sneer almost every day of his life. South Carolinaattempted to justify her act of secession bydeclaring "the Union a Shibboleth of oppression."The expression is the language of a traitor, whetherused in Charleston or New York—whether comingfrom the lip of Governor Pickens or Horace Greeley.Both these men have used it. Pickens avowed it andacted on it, in 1861; Greeley and Thompson avowedand desired to act upon it, in 1850. Greeley callsPickens a "rebel;" yet Pickens has done nothingmore than adopt and practice Greeley's] own axioms. Tribune's desired Mr. Greeley claims to be a Union man in 1864,and we are forced to admit that ha is a Union man.But we certainly do not owe his Unionism to hisloyalty. He derided and sneered at the Union asa "shibboleth of oppression" in 1850, and, with WendellPhillips, wished to see it destroyed; and if be hasespoused the Union cause since then, it is for someother, reason than patriotic affection for it—St.Louis Union. St.Louis Union.
