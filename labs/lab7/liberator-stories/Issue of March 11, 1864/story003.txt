 George Thompson, of England, has come to ourshores again, and is being glorified in Boston. Whenbe was here before, he was followed and fawned uponby a certain uneasy and conceited class, and he hasbeen in correspondence with them, more or less,ever since, and has been quite a big gun, in his popgunwat, of that foolish and functionless abolitionwherewith it has been the practice of our Britishcousins to pelt us for the last twenty years. Andnow there is a likelihood that he and his admirerswill as such overrate themselves as they did before.He sounded a note before he started, to the effectthat laving been among the first exposers of the sinof slavery in this country, he hoped to be in timeto me it wiped out. Men of Mr. Thompson's quality—and the chargestrikes at a good many self-sufficient folks here athoome—have not been the important movers in emancipationthat they suppose themselves. Emancipatinghas thriven in spite of them. They always advocateda policy that would have made slavery apermanency in this country; and nothing saved theNorth from the disgrace and dishonor which theSouth has heaped upon itself, except the fact thatthese men were in a small minority.—N.Y. Exempted(Baptist.) not N.Y. Exempted Baptist.
