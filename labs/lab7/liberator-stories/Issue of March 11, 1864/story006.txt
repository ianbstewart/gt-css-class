 BIOGRAPHY OF GEO. THOMPSON, ESQ. BY WILLIAM FARMER, ESQ. Mr. Thompson's connection with the Anti-CornLaw League, which was in fact a society for theabolition of the slavery which the landocracy ofthis country had imposed upon its industry, commencedsoon after his rejection of the tempting offermade to him by the Protectionists; but in 1841be rendered that organization—and through it thecountry at large—a service, which, if not the proximate,was the remote cause of the abolition of thebread tax, and other imposts upon the necessariesof life, shortly afterwards. His continued travelsthroughout the United Kingdom Had brought himinto contact with most of toe leading ministers ofreligion of all denominations, with the greater portionof whom he had entered into relationships ofwarm personal friendship. He was thus enabled togather together, from every part of the country,six hundred and forty-five ministers of religion ofevery communion, in addition to twenty-two lettersof sympathy from others who were unable to bepresent, and one characteristic snubbing epistlefrom the present canon McNeile of Liverpool, anda second of a like nature from the Rev. W.M. Bunting,son of the Rev. Jabez Bunting, D.D., thenthe great head of the Wesleyan body. I purposereferring somewhat at length to this Con venison,for two reasons; first, because I regard it as one ofthe most important services which Mr. Thompsonever rendered to his country and the world; andsecondly, because of the catholic spirit then breathedby its speakers, which strikingly contrasts with thenarrow, pharisaical exclusiveness with which thesesame gentlemen excommunicated the AmericanAbolitionists on account of the alleged heterodoxyof a portion of their members. Happily, this serialproscription has become as event of the past; batit teaches a lessee which may be very useful in preventingour high-class Brahmins from falling intosimilar inconsistency in future. As Mr. Thompsonhas been gravely censored by them for associatingwith such theological pariahs as William Lloyd Harrisonand his colleagues, a reference to the inconsistencybetween speech and action of his arrest ismay be a sufficient answer to their reproaches, andform a not inappropriate portion of his biography.The Rev. Dr. Massie stated that "It was his honorto have been associated, from the first conceptionof this measure, with his distinguished friend, Mr.Thompson, the honorary secretary of the preliminarycommittee, whose name bad become the commonproperty of philanthropy, benevolence and patriotism."This is the very reason assigned by Mr.Thompson for deeming it an honor to ha associatedwith the American Abolitionists. The Doctorthen proceeds—"It was to avoid the appearance ofany tinge of sectarianism that the invitations to thismeeting had been issued in his name." Mr. Thompsonwas appointed as the convener of the meeting,because he was wholly unsectarian. The Rev. T,Smith, A.M., Theological Tutor of Rotherham College,spoke of Mr. Thompson's name as "the commonproperty of the church and the public." Mr.Thompson was called upon to deliver the farewelladdress, which was one of the most eloquent speecheshe ever delivered. He thus described the catholicspirit of assembly, waited only upon one paint,—the philanthropic object for which they had —"The  spectacle has, for the first timein the annals of the world, been presented of sevenhundred ministers of religion, of widely varyingtheological opinions, assembling together; not onlywithout discord, contention and  but witha negroes of  love and and consideration one towards another, deservingthe highest admiration, and furnishing the demonstrationthat, where the good of our common humanityis fought, such can merge the differwhich divide  out of doors, in a generous andcombined effort for the reverse of their sufferingbrethren. (Loud applause.) Your conference hasbeen distinguished by catholicity without compromise;by a storm maintenance of the cardinal principlesof Christian morality, without the slightestabatement of your attachment to those peculiaritiesby which, as sects and religious parties, you areknown." What language could mere aptly or eloquentlydescribe the platform of the American Anti-SlaverySociety? And yet many of the menwho joined in the loud applause of this liberal sentimenthave subsequently censured Mr. Thompsonfor his philanthropic association with American Abolitionists,because some of them did not exactlypronounce their own theological shibboleth! Thesame anti-slavery application may also be made ofthe following passage"—" Prompted by a feeling ofhumanity, inspired by the genius of the gospel, andtouched with pity for the miseries of those aroundthem, a noble army of seven hundred men—thesoldiers of Christ, the preachers of righteousness, thefriends of the poor and the perishing—have lefttheir homes, and the altars at which they minister,and have come up to the help of the Lord, to thehelp of the Lord against the mighty. (Hear, hear, andapplause.) There have not been wanting those who,by anticipation, have poured contempt on the nobleeffort. Predictions of failure, charges of incompetencethe imputation of low and sordid motives,have been plentiful. But your numbers, your demeanor,the spirit you have displayed, the wisdomyou have brought to the task, the absence of everypetty and party feeling, by which all your doingshave been characterized, these have scattered thefears of the timid and the hopes of the wicked tothe winds, and have given the friends of perishinghumanity assurance that the ministers of religion inGreat Britain, from Caithness to Cornwall, andfrom Cape Clear to Holy head, are men who can,when necessary, bury in one grave their polemicalanimosities and their partisan predilections, and, asbrethren, unite to assert the rights of the poor, andjustify the ways of God toward the children ofmen." And yet, many of the men who thus cheeredthe noble sentiments of Mr. Thompson, havesince turned out the most ultra sectarian purists,wearing the broadest of phylacteries, and pouringtheir ecclesiastical anathemas upon him, because heunited with some men of a different faith to hisown; because in his language of 1841, he consentedto "bury in one grave their polemical animositiesand their partisan predilections, and as brethrenunite to assert the rights of the poor slave, and justifythe ways of God towards the children of men."Nor was the expression of this catholic spirit byany means confined to Mr. Thompson. The firstday's chairman, the Rev. Thomas Adkins, in openingthe proceedings, asked for what the conferencewas commenced; and then gave the following replyto the question:—"Not to place themselves inhostile array, sect against sect, and party againstparty, (applause,) within the narrow lines of sectariandenomination; not to hurl at each other thebrutem fulmen of excommunication, placing the unhappydelinquent under the ban of exclusion in thisworld, and consigning him to final perdition in theworld to come; not to harmonize the jarring shibbolethsof conflicting creeds; but men, brethrenand fathers, occupied and interested by an objectgreater than which can hardly enter into the mindsof the most eminent Christians, but less than whichcannot satisfy ours. (Loud applause.) WE are mettogether, then, brethren and fathers, at the call ofsuffering humanity, (applause,) and that call reachesus, not across the briny ocean, but through the greenvalleys and populous streets of our own native land.We are, I admit, met at the very outset of our procedureby a query, "what have Christians, and,more than all, Christian ministers, to do with temporalpolitics?" But I have yet to learn that, whenwe become denizens of that kingdom which is notof this world, we are to forego the immunities, andforget the duties that relate to the present life.I have yet to learn how, when we begin to be Christians,we cafes to be men." Is it not a lamentablefact that many of these Orthodox ministers did subsequentlymost grievously apostatize from this trulycatholic faith? that they burled their brutem futmen ofexcommunication against the American Abolitionists;that they placed them under the ban of the odiumtheologicum, although professing perfect agrsementwith their anti-slavery principles? Dr. Pye Smithsaid, "We have come together in no capacity, assumedor implied, expressed or imagined, of authority.We are not a conclave nor a synod,nor a convocation. We disclaim any pretensions ofa right to make laws or regulations, or any desire tobind the consciences of our fellow Christians, or tocommand their practice." They were willing thento suspend for the time, for the sake of the commoncause and the broadest possible platform, their owndenominational peculiarities, however fundamentalthey might regard them in themselves. Dr. Halley,for example, objected to vocal prayer, not for himself,but because there were Roman Catholic priestsin the conference, to whose it would act be agreeable;surely, in an Evangelical Congregationalist,that was going a long way in concession for thesake of philanthropic union; much more thanwould be needed on the anti-slavery platform."Why should those who agreed with him arrogateto themselves any right to conduct the religious services?Was it became they constituted a majority?He trusted the meeting would not be influenced byany such reason. They had to consider the wantsof the poor; and he hoped the apple of religiousdiscord would not be thrown in to mar their effortsat removing them." The Rev. Mr. Sibree, of Coventry,said, "We have agreed to  the swordof theological controversy, and to unite in promotingan object worthy of our best energies, and dearto every Briton, especially to every British Christian—the welfare of our country, and the happinessof our fellow-men. Let the priest and Levita,the selfish and the inhuman, pass by on the otherside; but let us, as good Samaritans, gather roundthe wounded, woe-bygone traveler, and pour in oiland wine, and thus illustrate and answer the inquiry,'why is my neighbor?' In many points oftheology we may differ; but there is one doctrinewe all believe, one principle we all support onecreed to which we all subscribe; it is that containedin the golden rule, 'whatsoever ye would that menshould do unto you, do ye even so to them.' TheSubject: which has called us together is of no ancharacter. The gross and Lemont of slavingmillions is not the cry of a net or party. Ethylic and Wesleyan,feel alike she iron band of the oppressivebreed tax, which in the infection of its tortures isat least no respecter of per. The cry of thewidow and fatherless is not the cry of a it be of that sect which among the always oppressed." The Rev. Mr.  of  for it was a  of  of The Rev. Thomas S an Eof Hi Char said, "It was becauseof their great zeal for a great object which madethem overlook all minor differences, and not allowthemselves to be disturbed or diverted from thegreat object for which they had  (Loudapplause.) I have such a him in my mind in favorof liberty that I prefer being where there is avariety of sentiment to  with those who areall of one mind. I like this approximation and tendencyto one common centre; it is the best sign inour day. (Applause.) And if this object forwhich we are met will not draw men together, andcause them to lose all party spirit, all bitter hatredand malice towards one another, I don't know whatwill." The Rev. S.J. Phillips, Catholic priest ofLiverpool, "expressed his gratification to see gentlemenof such various theological opinions, uniting soharmoniously in the cause of the poor." Would itnot have been equally gratifying to see them unitingin the cause of the poor slave? The Rev. F.A.Cox, D.D., who had abounded the American Abolitionistsas dangerous l on account of acertain amount of alleged heterodoxy existingamong them said to this assembly of Episcopaliansand Presbyterians, Papists and Protestants, Trinitariansand Unitarians, Baptists and Swedenborgians,Inghamites, Calvinists and Armenians—"Gentlemen,why should we be here? I ask why we should notbe here? (Loud cheers.) Is any principle sacrificed?(Cries of "No!") Is any duty neglected?(No!) Are the more interests of a party, theologicalor political, subserved? (No!) Our principleis to love God supremely, and our neighbor as ourselves.Our duty is to do good by whatever meanswe can accomplish it." Why not then, professing tolong for the freedom of the slave, units with his bestand truest friend, Mr. Garrison, for the accomplishmentof that object? What kept the Doctor awayfrom such a righteous association in America?Nothing but those very theological differenceswhich he trod under foot with indignant contemptin Manchester. Had he been converted to his newand catholic views after he returned home fromAmerica? Then he was, as a Christian and a man,bound to have made the amende honorable to theAmerican Abolitionists for his former fault. It washis duty to have left his gift upon the altar, and tohave sought reconciliation with his injured brother,before he presented it. Quotations of catholic expressions,similar to the above might he greatly multipliedfrom the speeches then delivered. I havecited them, somewhat at length to show that theserever gentlemen and not Mr. Thompson, havesubsequently a from the great fundamentalprinciple of liberality, by which the conferenceof 1841 was united, and upon which alone it couldhave acted. If the imposition of a theological test.as a term of communion was wrong on the subjectof the bred tax what makes it right on the questionof slavery?        brutem fulmen brutem futmen odiumtheologicum                        not amende honorable   Those who know the history of the Anti-Slaverymovement will understand the relevancy of thoseobservations in a sketch of the public career ofserration that the frowns the cold-shoulders, thedrawing-room whisperings and systematic detractionwhich he had to endure, solely on account ofhis faithfulness to the American Abolitionists, andhis  rebukes of British churches for their unfaithfulnessto the cause of the slave, have amountedto absolute p They are by no meansthe least of the great sacrifices which he has beencalled upon to make for the cause of emancipation.The reticence of the churches upon the subject,with few exceptions cannot be regarded as an immaterialsin of omission. By fellowshipping theleading divines of the apostate American churches,they gave vitality and power to the pro-slavery influenceswhich they were exerting in Great Britainas well as America. It may be a grave charge, butit is nevertheless true, that this pro-slavery action,positive as well as negative of British churches, hasbeen the cause of the fearful loss of life and treasurein the American civil war, and of the all butstate of starvation of our operatives in the North.There can be no question that the South would neverhave attempted to  nor have fired a shotat Fort Sumter, had it not been for her full relianceupon recognition by Great Britain and the consequentbreaking up of the blockade by our ships ofwar. Upon what was that power of mammon;but mainly upon the pro-slavery leaven which sheknew had been infused into the churches. The breakageof the block ade would have led to a war with England,which would have had a double action It wouldhave weakened the North, by dividing its poweragainst two enemies instead of one; and it wouldhave doubled or trebled the material resources ofthe South. Had the data reasoned upon been well-founded,we doubt rebel Dom would have succeededin achieving her independence. The great miscalculationof the South was that her Delilah's had effectuallyshor the locks of public opinion in GreatBritain; she did not imagine that there wasstrength enough left in it to pull down the houseabout the ears of the uncircumcised Philistines.Lord Stanley, upon introducing the EmancipationBill into the House of commons in 1833, said trulythat "When the Christian public of this countryspoke eat in the deep conviction of their religiousprinciple, it was with a power which no Parliamentnor cabinet would neglect nor despise." Had thehigh-tined anti-slavery principle which prevailed inGreat Britain in 1833 been maintained in referenceto American slavery, and had the same catholic basisof union existed amongst Abolitionists which wasadopted by the Manchester Conference in 1841,American slavery would, ere this, have been undera process of gradual, if not total and speedyabolition. It is true that the evils of the past cannotnow be remedied, and, therefore, that no goodpurpose can be sub served by now expatiating uponthe sins of the churches; but, nevertheless, theymay serve as beacons to warn them fro future dangersand point out the rocks upon which they maymake shipwreck, if they neglect the chart of rightprinciple.     That there was some c besides the allegedh for this prejudice against the AmericanAbolitionists is demonstrated by the following facts:—no such scruples were exhibited in our own antislaverysocieties by the Orthodox ministers.

What than was the something else whichmade all the difference with the American Abolitionists?Simply the pro-slavery slanders of Americandivines in this country.
