 On the 9th day of March last, the United StatesTax C for the District of South Carolinaafford for public sale at  in of a law of congress, for the collection of taxes,76,775 acres of land.    Of this amount,  acres were purchased bythe United States and 16,479 acres, or about 46plantations, including small islands, were sold to privateportions. All the lands were situated on St.Helens, Ladies, Port Royal and Perry's Island.  On the 16th day of September last, the Presidentof the United States issued instructions to saidTax Commissioners. On the 12th of December,these instructions were published in the "FreeSouth," and occupied two and a quarter columns infine print, and contemplate the disposal of the balanceof the lands bid in and now absolutely upwardby the United State, viz.: 60,296 acres. These instructionsreserve 6,061 acres for school purposes,and 13,370 acres for "war, military, naval, revenueand police" purposes, leaving  acres to be 24,316 of those acres are to be put into lots not exceeding320 acres each, to be sold at public sale;the balance, or 16,529 acres, are to be sold at privatesale "to the heads of familiars of the Africanrace." FreeSouth   On the 5th of December, the Commissioners, intheir advertisement of the public sale to take placeon February say that "the lands tobe sold comprehend in all about  acres"—or,according to the above estimate, 24,316 acres. Hereis a slight inaccuracy, but it is not material for thispurpose.   If we add the 24,316 acres to the 16,479 acressold in March last, we shall have 40,795 acres inlarge tracts which will have been sold when the salecloses in February, only to the capitalist; and acres to be divided into lots not to exceed 20acres, "at such sum, not less than $1.25 per acre, asthe said Commissioner shall designate and determineas proper to be charged for said lands" to thenegroes. only to the capitalist  not to exceed For the capitalist, then, we have  acres.  For the negro, we have 16,479 acres. In 40,795 acres, there are 1271 lots, con$20 acres. If we put a white family of five personson each of these lots, it will make an aggregate populationof 637, or 54 acres per head.  If we reckon the colored population on St. Port Royal, Ladies and Parry's divide  acres among them, it will be 206 acresper head; or,    The white man gets 32 chances at the land, whilethe negro gets 1 chance. Here in Port Royal, where the eyes of all thoughtfuland because men, not only in our country butabroad, are hopefully  what do such facts andfigures prove? Truth is, that, so far as the purchaseris concurred, the United States Tax Commissioners,for the district of South Carolina sold,in March last, the fairest, best  and mostfertile portion of these lands, including the bust ofthe building, for, on the average, about  centsper acre, being 25 per cent, below government pricefor the lands  under the late instruction of thePresident, dated December  Now theypropose by their advertisement which appears this,the 6th day of February,  thirty seven daysafter the President's  of Dec. in twelve days from this date  acres in 320acres lots, to only such as can afforded to buy. Andwho are these? "The negro,"  any one say,singly or in combination? No,  no!But to the capitalist, who,  by the price of cotton, comes hare to run these  andlaborers at the ex to make the greatestamount of money in the shortcut and then be off.    for the lands               If Hundreds of thousands of dollars here at cotton growing, is it not the  of goodloyal freedom, now  from  to corn this money, and speed it long uponhimself, and to  up the  of his and Is it wise to alter the  and to make this money at the exports of thedown and opened it  If thispractise is to be perused, the  of these peopleare not worth a throw. It is                 The most mean this? Do the People mean it? Is this, here'within our military lines, with not the shadow of arebel near, with everything our own way, with thegreatest opportunity to do justice to the oppressed,and to bring in full play the nobilities of our bestnature—in it here, and now, that the American Peoplemean to stake their reputation on the inaugurarationof such a land monopoly as this? Are wegoing to  the British West Indian drama bylong years of injustice after emancipation? Do wemean feudalism? Are we going to take away theslave from the Southern oligarch, who has madefor us this rebellion, and bind him over to anothersystem of servitude, only modified in form, and thenadd hypocrisy to injustice as often as we pronouncein his presence the sacred name of freedom?          the People American People  after The white man and capitalist, then, with all hisintelligence, with the advantage of almost a countryof republican liberty, the spirit of which down to him through the ages of the of theproudest nation on earth, is to start in the race withthe poor uninstructed negro, crushed by 240 yearsof unrequited toil and degradation. Three hundredand twenty acres with the white man on oneside, and two acres with the negro on the other, andthis to be the basis of Southern life and the futurepolicy of the American people! Do we seriouslymean this? If we do, then God save the mark!  Not the  rebel in rebeldom, when humbledin the dust before the Union flag, could desirea better gain for his losses than this. He would,verily, have occasion to thank these Commissionersfor carving out for him a system of oppression somuch better than he could do it for himself.  Bear in mind, that this little formula of 32 to 1 is,in the estimation of these learned Commissioners, tobe the expression, throughout all future time, of themeasure of justice to be imparted by our commoncountry to the colored man. On the 16th day of January, or thereabout, theCommissioners received another order from the President,inaugurating justice to the negro, and equalrights to all. When it was announced in that littlechurch on St. Helena Island, the many moistenedeyes, more eloquent than words, told us how acceptableit was, and filled us with hope, for once, for thetemporal salvation of the colored race. for once Shall we, who owe the race so heavy a debt, dashthis hope to the earth, and leave the debt unpaid?—The Free South. F.J.W. The Free South.
