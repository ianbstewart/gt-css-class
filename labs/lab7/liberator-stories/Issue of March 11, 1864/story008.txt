 This most eloquent of modern Englishmen is againin this country. When he visited us last, in 1850,it was as an abolitionist. His eloquence, his logiccould be answered only in one way, and that themethod common at the South. He was mobbed inFaneuil Hall. He was burned in effigy at Springfield.All ignorant and brutal prejudice was stirredup against him. His philanthropy was made to appearofficious inter and his honest desire tosee this country truly prosper by ridding itself ofslavery was interpreted into a desire a  withour institutions and involve us in trouble.   Time has shown who were our true and who ourfalse friends. The men in England are regarded asour best friends in the days of our compromisingdegradation, were prompt to take sides with the rebelswhen our troubles come. Those who had aidedwith us in their weather, wished us a speedy wreckwhen the storm came. But George Thompson wasamong the noble men who early and  the cause of the North. He gave goodfor evil. Before the war, we know him only as anabolitionist. Since the strife began, he has been an and devoted friend of President Lincoln, the     Mr. Thompson was bred in a  house inLondon, and it was not till  that he —known to the public. At that time he  thegreat speech of Dr. Thompson of  in of before the champion of Freedom. The with enormous, logic,  of the letter  him the victory.                    After the  of the West India Mr. Thompson  to this country, but away.  he sword  attention tothe affairs of British India,  the eight ofthe natives against the  and oppression ofthe East India Company. In  he and was received  a  with longprocessions of richly  and with cymbals and  and escorted with allthe gorgeous pomp of the  however, with investigation, and on his returnmade his attack on the East India House, in defenceof the dethroned Rajah. He made a great and a  ensured that recalled the days ofLord Clive and Warren Hastings. It was anera in the history of the Court of Proprietors, andhis eloquent place for justice and honor were not invain.                    In the Corn Law struggle, he fought side by sidewith Cobden and Bright, and swung the blade in the Free Trade contest. In 1847, he waselected by a majority unprecedentedly large to theHouse of Commons. He was an advocate of universalsuffrage, of the dissolution of the union ofChurch and State, and free education.  Mr. Thompson's oratory we have never heardequaled. His compass is greater than that of sayspeaker we know. Other may excel him in certainthings, but he is remarkable in everything. Inlofty fights he is irresistible, full of passion and thefire of genius; his  is terrible; and yes hispathos is more moving, his wit is very keen, and hishumor is so taking that, at times, you think he wouldhave made the best comedian in the world; and,withal, he is the most graceful, polished and elegantof speakers. He recalled to us, when we heard himin 1850, what we had read of the greatest oratorsof the English parliament, when such men as Barkeand Fox and Sheridan were its ornaments. Uponan occasion when Mr. Thompson had been speakingon the formation of the British India Society, LordBrougham arose and said: "I have always pleasurein listening to Mr. Thompson, who is the most accomplishedorator whom I know." There could notbe higher praise; but those who hear him will belikely to endorse it.—Hertford Press.  Hertford Press.
