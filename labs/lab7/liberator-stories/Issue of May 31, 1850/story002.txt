 Of course, no better service could have been renderedto the Anti-Slavery, Society then this performedfor them by the Herald and Rynders gang, whosebrutality is only equalled by the stupidity of theirSouthern Patrons. The Anti-Slavery Society livesby agitation, and its leaders and managers are gratefulover-much for so lucky a lift. The Herald couldnot have does its Southern friends a greater disservicethan to instigate this riot. As soon as the irrefutable truth was announced,that the origin of all slavery was the monopoly of thesoil, the Anti-Slavery Society, above all existing organizations,ought to have adopted that truth, andstruck, boldly and consistently, against the masterevil. That it did not do so must have been owingeither to imbecility or dishonesty. Its leaders eitherwere not so good judges of the Right as they assumedto be, or they were profiling by wages slaveryand land monopoly themselves, and not quite patrioticenough to strike against their own property inmonopolized soil, though quite willing to sacrificeother people's property in human flesh, a propertynot a whit more iniquitous than the other.(!!) profiling Still, the Anti-Slavery Society had a right to meetand agitate, and in the light of the above-namedtruths; all they had to fear was that they would beallowed to do so peaceably. Hence the rowdyismof the Herald and Captain Rynders was a godsendfor them, and probably will prolong their existencefor a year or so. They want to abolish the Union,and would have, I suppose, in each Northern State,a Despotism of Capital monopolizing every thing,and especially the Homesteads of the People, as fastas legislation (entirely controlled by it) can enableit to do so, like that of Massachusetts!
