 Fred. Douglass, the impudent negro who done oflate taken upon himself the privilege of abusing ourcountry, its Patriots and Constitution, without havingthat chastisement which he so richly merited atthe hands of our republicans who could condescendto notice his blasphemy and negroism, had the audacityyesterday to walk down Broadway, the principalpromenade in our city, with two white femalesresting on his arms. Several, citizens who had noticedthin disgraceful scene, followed the impudentscamp to the Battery. on observing that he waswatched, the negro kept laughing and sneering atthe gentlemen who were behind him. One of themcould not withstand the provoked and justifiabletemptation to award to the negro that punishmentwhich his daring reacality had subjected him to. Thegentleman stepped up to him, and politely requestedthe females to leave their ebony companion, andplace themselves under the protection of gentlemanwho was standing near by. The women very quietlydid as they were desired to do, and then the indignantand insulted gentleman administered to theback of the negro a 'dressing' that he will have occasionto remember hence. Maddened justice forgetsthe dictates of law in case of this kind; and personalitywe can see no reason why it should act. [â˜ž This statement in regard to the ault uponMr. Douglass it, we trust, a vile fabrication.]
