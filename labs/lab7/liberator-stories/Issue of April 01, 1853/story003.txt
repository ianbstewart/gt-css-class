 This law we do not hesitate to pronounce unjust,but brutal in the extreme, and is another of theresults which have been secured by those rampantspirits who set law and order at defiance, and joinin treasonable demonstrations against the Governmentfor the purpose of overturning the establishedprecedents which have guided us in days past, andbreaking down all barriers interposed between theConstitution and traitors. One of the fruits oftheir insane proceedings is seen in the passage ofsuch a disgraceful enactment, which, as the law ofthat State, must be obeyed. Must be obeyed wesay, for we hold it to be a self-evident principle,that to preserve the institutions of our land freefrom innovation, every citizen is bound to obey thelaws which have been enacted in accordance withthe established Constitution. We regret that we are called upon to record thepassage of this law, for we cannot but consider itinhuman and cruel. The colored race are permittedto enjoy very many privileges at the North,which, if their pretended friends persist in 'spittingupon the Constitution,' may be curtailed by asudden, ill-timed and injudicious movement. Weshould he sorry to see such a state of things existing,and we hope and pray the efforts of a fewfanatics may never bring upon us that shame. Wewish to live in peace and harmony with all people,and if a few hot heads are held in curb, there willbe no difficulty in so doing.â€”Albany Transcript. Albany Transcript.
