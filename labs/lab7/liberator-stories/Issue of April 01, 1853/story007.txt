 A correspondent of the New York Evening Post,in Missouri, in giving a sketch of affairs in thatState, concludes his letter as follows:— Evening Post 'But while I speak thus of slaveholders in Missouri,the free State of Illinois has just passedone of the most atrocious, and, as I believe, unconstitutionallaws, which ever disgraced a statutebook. I enclose you a copy. It is a crimeagainst civilization, against liberty, against Christianity,against God. Without crime, without immorality,without pauperism, with every Christianvirtue, and with wealth, a man upon whom hasbeen forced one-fourth tincture of African blood,may be sold into slavery, if he steps over the sacredlimits of free suckerdom! There is not a gentlemanSouth of the Potomac, or West of the Mississippi,whose honorable feeling does not revolt atthe selling of a free-born colored man into slavery,without crime, and without his being otherwisea charge upon the State. We regard them as anunfortunate race, and for that very reason to beprotected, and not victimized. But the Stateacross the river has passed an act—notwithstandingthe ordinance of '87—for the institution ofslavery. It is not services that are sold. It isthe man himself that is sold, and if there is nocompetition at the sale, he is sold for life; and Illinoisis a slave State. I believe Indiana has a lawapproximating in sublimity to this. The Southwould soon amend her institutions, if let alone.Allow me to recommend a diversion to the Garrisonitesand Parkerites; to turn their attention tothose two free States above mentioned, and theirown more particular sisterhood, and let a truceprevail betwixt the South and them for a while.It will be productive of mutual benefit. 'I sincerely hope, Messrs. Editors, that yourown paper, and every other honorable organ ofpublic opinion, North and South, will notice thisnew slave State in such complimentary terms asthe law deserves; and especially its provision fora charity fund.'
