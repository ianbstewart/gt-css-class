 During the warm discussion on slavery, beforethe New School Presbyterian Assembly, Rev. Mr.Crowine, of California, embodied in a condensedform the sentiments and arguments of his Southernbrethren in a series of Resolutions. Have are theResolutions; they will do:— Resolved, That this Assembly express their devoutthankfulness in view of the fact that the vexed questionof slavery has at length been settled to the satisfactionof all good men; justifying the entire systemupon the conduct Biblical interpretation, by thehighest judicial tribunals, and by the voice of thepeople, which is the voice of God. Resolved Resolved, That we deprecate the wide spreadAtheism prevailing in many of the churches at theNorth, where, according to common fame, the churchmembers are still fellowshipped and held to be ingood standing, who are so ignorant or so perverseas to avow their belief in the 'glittering generalities'and 'sounding abstractions' of that infamousdocument known as the Declaration of Independence: Resolved Resolved, That with shame and confusion of facewe confess the complicity of Witherspoon and hiscompatriots, the Fathers of the American PresbyterianChurch, with the Atheistic principles avowedin that accursed document; and since the iniquitiesof the fathers are visited upon the children to thethird and fourth generations, and there is no evidencethat they ever repented of their sins, we hold it tobe the duty of this church now to repent in theirbehalf, and so may this most terrible of all heresies,Atheism, be purged from our midst. Resolved Resolved, That while we regard all politics asbelonging, not to the things which concern theChristian, bat to lie within the province of theDevil, since whatever is for law is not of grace, we begpardon for encroaching upon his jurisdiction so far asto express our unqualified approval of the doctrineof the Supreme Court, that the negro is not a man,and that the black has no rights which the whiteman is bound to respect. Recognizing the said courtas the highest judicial authority known to thischurch for the interpretation of the Constitution,we gladly accept their decision with all its consequences,logical and practical, be the same more orless. And we solemnly enjoin all our fanaticalbrethren who have hitherto desecrated the sacreddesk by appeals for the liberation and elevation ofthe blacks, that they desist from further insane effortsto educate, to emancipate, to colonize, or toevangelize them. Resolved Resolved, That our mission as ministers and eldersof the church of Christ is a mission to men and notto chattels, whether brutes or things, and hence itbecomes a desecration of sacred right to administerthem to mere sable burlesques upon humanity. Resolved Resolved, That we glory in the spirit of thatchivalric Presbytery which throws down the gauntlet,assumes the positions and responsibilities of thedead, assails its simplicity with chattel Slavery, anddefies the General Assembly to proceed to disciplinethem—in other words, come into court, boldly confesstheir criminality, and beg leave to be gauntlet,without benefit of clergy. Resolved Resolved, That we hail with gratitude the risingstar of Empire in Utah, and, rejoice in the re-establishmentof a patriarchal institution kindred tothat which is secured by the blessing pronouncedupon Ham, and defended upon precisely the sameprinciples. Resolved
