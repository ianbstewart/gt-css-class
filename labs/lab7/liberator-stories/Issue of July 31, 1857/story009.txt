 Less than half a handled miles from St. Louis,as I traveled through Missouri, I could not but remarkthe tame and quiet aspect of the country, exhibitinga sad want of enterprise among the people in thatparticular neighborhood; fences almost concealed inthe thick brash, grown up inside as well as outsidethe fields, houses of most sombrous appearance,wanting even in the cleanly show a peck of lime andand an hour's work would impart. Looking atthe rich soil and pondering the unthrifty appearanceof the country, I rode along in the stillness of themorning, 'no sound disturbing the quiet, save the occasionalreport of the gun of some hunter of pettygame far up or down the valley; in the sound themselvesI thought I found to some extent a solutionof the question of why it was that land so fertilewas so badly tilled; farmers were out squirrel huntingwhile the spring-time was upon them, and thefences not yet repaired. While I was meditatingon the change a few years will produce in that regionof country, a sudden turn on the road broughtme to one of those beautiful streams of water foundcurved among the hills every few miles along myroute, and the sound of a water-fall, mingled withthe rattle, clatter, and buzzing sounds of a mill, saintedmy ears, while a some presented itself so highlycontrasting with everything in the surroundingcountry, that the very contrast seemed to invest itwith new beauties. There stood a fine flouring andsawmill, with numerous wagons being loaded andunloaded, horses receiving and being relieved of theirburdens, numerous small boys perched on the top ofbags of meal or flour, turning their horses' headhomeward, bringing to my mind the wood-cut atthe head of a campaign paper in 1844; dozens ofmen were piling and handing lumber; the wholescene, in fact, wearing an unmistakable look of bustleand business, as though the energy of the wholeneighborhood had been centered in that particularspot. A little further on, crowning the summit ofan eminence overlooking the scene I have attemptedto describe, was a handsome residence built in modernstyle, neat and tasteful in every part, while upand down the stream large fields of wheat and greenmeadows were spread out so picturesquely that withmy admiration there arose a desire to know the possessorof such fine property. He was pointed out tome by one of the laborers; on approaching him, Iwas received with an affable and courteous manner,and was soon in possession of all the informationdesired. He was a native of Massachusetts, hadnot yet reached middle age, came to Missouri sixyears ago, went to work to start a manufacturingestablishment in the neighborhood where he nowlives, found no encouragement but met with everyopposition, was denounced as a Yankee and an Abolitionist,threats were made to drive him from thecountry, influential men deliberately went to workto organize a system to foment opposition to him;he soon found himself without a dollar, but withinhim there was that which is worth more than money—there was a will, a determined energy whichlaughs at poverty. Friends, for he had some friendseven there, came to his assistance with a few hundreddollars, and on three acres of land, there in theundisturbed forest, he began the erection of his mill,soon had it up and going, paid off all his liabilities,now owns eight hundred acres of the fine landaround him, he has been offered $20,000 for hisproperty, thought it not half its worth, was improvingit all the tune, hired all his labor. three acres eight hundred acres In answer to a question as to his political opinions,he answered freely, 'I am a Free Soiler, sir;' andpointing around him over his fields he added, 'Hereare eight hundred acres of free soil in Missouri, andit shall glow to be eight thousand acres.'—Correspondent of the Missouri Democrat.
