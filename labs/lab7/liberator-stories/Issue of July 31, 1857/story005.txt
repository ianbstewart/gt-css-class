 A correspondent of the Easton (Md.) Star, writingto that paper under date of June 27, thus exultsover the evidences that Philadelphia, in spiteof her noble traditions, is a pro-slavery city. Star 'The editor of the Gazette, in noticing Mr.Long's abolition book, refers to Philadelphia, incidentally,as 'an abolition city'; and, while such isthe fact, it may be supposed by strangers, that abolitionist very generally; allow me tosay that such is not the case. At the last municipalelection, the Republican vote reached only 4200out of more than 50,000 cast. A more importantfact in this connection is, that Mr. Long's book is asunpopular here as it can well be in Talbot. Lastweek, a colporteur, filled with love and zeal for sufferingwoolly heads, started one morning to sell the'Pictures'; at evening, he returned with ruefulvisage, 'an uglier and a madder man,' bringingback every book he carried out. He told Mr. Long,that wherever he offered it for sale, he was threatenedto be kicked out of doors! Nobody wantedhim to talk about it. The 'colporteur' resigned indisgust, and is less a 'bleeding Kansas' man todaythan when he first went 'booking.' Gazette abolitionist  every book he carried out. Mr. Long is not tar enough North and East to findmuch sympathy. Philadelphians are not fond of fosteringthe wild isms of worn-out fanatics, and havelittle patience with those who would risk their reputationfor a men of abolition glory. The 'worn-out'gentry should make a note of this before theydetermine to play upon Mr. Long's 'harp of onestring.' We are not far enough to the 'norrid.'
