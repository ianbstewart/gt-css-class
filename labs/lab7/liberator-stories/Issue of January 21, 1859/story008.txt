 NEW YORK, NOV. 19th, 1858. EW ORK OV. To the Editor of the New York Times. To the Editor of the New York Times. SIR: In your paper of 17th instant, I find a 'Retrospectof a Year's Crime,' taken from the FirstMetropolitan Police Report, in which the 'totalnumber of arrests' is stated to have been '60,885';and, after a statement of 'the nativity of those arrested,'it is added, 'among then were 566 coloredpersons.' IR Now, since the colored people are so frequentlyspoken of as a degraded and vicious portion of ourpopulation, it is natural to inquire into the cost comparativenumber of arrests of colored persons for crime,in proportion to the relative number of the whiteand colored population of our city. I hare no meansof knowing the present number of either. But inthe census of 1850, p. 278, the whites are stated tobe 501,732, the colored 13,815;total, 515,547.This, if I mistake not, shows that the colored people,at that time, were about 2.68 per cent, of the entirepopulation. Assuming that the present population does notgreatly vary from that of 1850, the colored people,would compare favorably with the whites, in 1857-8,If 2.68 per cent, of the arrests should hare been fromamong them. But if I figure correctly, the 'FirstMetropolitan Police Report' shows that considerablyless than one per cent, (about 93 of 1 per cent.) ofthose arrested were colored. To state the matter in another form. If the coloredpopulation (now, as in 1850) be 2.68 percent. ofour population, then their arrests for crime, if in thesame proportion, would have been 1,63; whereas,by the Metropolitan Police Report, it was only 566,a difference or 1,065 in their favor. Ought not thisto be noticed, and recorded to their credit? Yours respectfully,WILLIAN GOODELL. ILLIAN OODELL.
