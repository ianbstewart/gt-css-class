 PARKVILLE, Mo., April 23d, 1855. ARKVILLE To THE PUBLICWhen our printing-office was destroyed, I wasabsent in Kansas Territory, and returned forth withon receiving information of it. I am filled with thedeepest concern for the events that have transpiredand the passions that hear away—premeditated asthey have been by a large and powerful secret association.I am happy to know that the citizens ofParkville and vicinity took no part in it; andWhy my life and property would be destroyed byany portion of this community, I cannot tell. Thecharge of abolitionism is false: I have never harboredthought nor meditated an action detrimentalthe honor, the interests, or institutionsof Missouri; but have labored unceasingly to promoteher prosperity. It is true, I have not believedthe honor and interests of Missouri to be inthat course of policy method out by come politicians.Duty has compelled me to cross theirpath, which has brought on my devoted head theBitterest persecution. UBLIC Our paper can be read. It will speak for itself.It does not claim perfection. The leadingObjects have been to promote the principles oftemperance, morality and —to take a conservativepolitical stand, and by moderating theextremes, and by softening sectional , topromote the general good of the country, and theprosperity of the American Union.   I love the South, and have spent the bapt energiesof my life to advance her interests and herglory. The battle-fields of Texas are eternal evidencesof the fast, for it was these individualenterprise gathered  the Houston,and by incredible hardships and almost man exercise, the independence of that  countrytry was achieved—now one of the in the constellation of States. And I fellow-citizens to attest the fast, that Wile I haveresided in Missouri, I have labored to promote her interests.       I love the North,  Never, while he lastsshall I forget the  kills of Vermont, whererests the grave of my mother, not the  ofthe men of 76; nor the virtue and energies ofthe men who have made there  a bosom-light—the wonder and  of the world;and I shall over look upon their glory as thecommon incidence of every  slaves.       With regard to having this commonly, I wouldas cheerfully, so  as I could depute of my have, were I  what a fosher  but to leave the gaveof my wife, the house I have  years to emboilish and improve, and many interest, interwovenwith the growth and prosperity of the country,and flee for no offence like a base culprit—I cannot!I would rather prefer death at my ownhome amid the flowers and trees planted and consecratedby affection, and upon the soil of thecountry I have toiled to build up!         Our press has been thrown into the Missouririver. I may be buried there too. An humbleindividual is in the power of hundreds of armedmen; but his death will not destroy the freedomof the AMERICAN PRESS! Independence of thoughtand action is inherent in the bosom of every freeman,and it will gush up like a perpetual fountainfor ever! God has impressed on his universethe principles of truth and justice, and they mustprevail. MERICAN RESS If there is no security in the land or Washington;if an American homo affords no protection;if the time has arrived when this Union must hedissolved, and all its kindred ties and mighty interestsbroken and destroyed, and our land drenchedwith fraternal blood; then let me be buried beneaththe turbid water, of the Missouri, ratherthan live to behold such a scene! God save ourcountry! GEO.S. PARK. MR. GEORGE S. PARK.—This gentleman, whoseconnection with the office of the Parkville Luminaryhas given him some notoriety, called to see usyesterday. The press upon which that paper wasissued was destroyed by citizen, of Platte county,and Mr. Park was notified to leave within a giventime. Not wishing to incur the resentment of thepeople who had thus treated him, and who, he says.were not citizens of Parkville, he has left that sectionof the country, and will probably take of hisresidence, for the time, on a farm he owns in Illinois. R. EORGE ARK. Luminary Mr. Park established the Luminary at Parkvillewithout any very strong political affinities, but ina very little time he was pushed into the supportof Benton and Bentonism, and this, we apprehend,may be regarded as the beginning of his troubles.In supporting Benton in his paper, the people wereled to suspect that he was not 'sound on the goosequestion,' but his antecedents are all against thissupposition. He is the owner of slaves—has grownup in Missouri, and acquired wealth, and we shouldnot suppose from his appearance and character thathe would make himself obnoxious to any class ofpeople.—St. Louis Intelligencer. Luminary St. Louis Intelligencer. The Parkville Luminary newspaper office wasmobbed and the press thrown into the Missouririver, because its editors bad published the followingmoderate rebuke of the outraged committed inKansas by citizens of Missouri. Read, and seehow much abolitionism there is in it: Luminary 'We have occupied conservative and nationalground, promptly opposing the measures and menwho have brought on this crisis. Will the Presidentmeet it' Surely he cannot longer followcounsels from Abolitionists and Nullifiers Thecountry demands that sound, firm, energetic menhave the direction of public affairs, who will impressand enforce justice and law. There is virtuallyno law in Kansas, and no security for lawand property, save in the sense of honor and justicecherished by every true pioneer. This MAYsave the country from the bloodshed, but the Governmentis held tip to ridicule and contempt, andits authority disregarded; judges of elections havebeen displaced and others appointed—the pollshave in some instances been guarded with pistolsand bowie knives—and some of those elected aregoing to the Governor swearing that if he does notgive a certificate of election immediately, they willcut his throat from ear to ear. Is the flag of ourcountry to be no longer a protection?—or are individualsor companies of men to declare WE WILL!and it must be so without regard to law! Is thiswhat the authors of the Kansas-Nebraska billmeant by popular sovereignty?
