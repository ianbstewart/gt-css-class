 The extraordinary bill, intended to deny a plainconstitutional provision; intended to nullify a lawof Congress; intended to bring the authorities ofthe Commonwealth into a confect with the authorities ofthe United States; intended to involve thecommunity in CIVIL WAR, passed yesterday to beengrossed in our Know Nothing House of Representatives!is now, or soon will be, before the Governorfor his signature! Such a bill as this has been again and againbrought before the General Court since 1850; butthere has been good sense enough, in one branch orthe other, to defeat this cherished purpose of abolitionfanatics. But no such good sense could belooked for in the present abolition set of legislators.Argument on such a body is lost. The infamousbill passed with but three votes against it in theSenate; and only 43 votes out of about 375 memberscould be rallied against it in the House! votes So both branches have done all they can to putMassachusetts out of the Union; to deliberatelydefy the laws of Congress as sustained by thejudgments of the Supreme Court, and every StateCourt in the Union—save only, one we believe, inWisconsin; to place the citizens of Massachusettsin direct conflict with the national government.The whole of that part of this infamous code thatdoes this—the whole of the portion that attemptsto substitute State proceedings, as to fugitive slaves,for the proceedings of existing of Congress,is Null and void; and who ever attempts to not underit will be liable to punishment. void Never before was this State so deeply disgraced.Shame on the ! Shame on the  toAmerican liberty! Is it possible  is sofor extinct in Massachusetts, and the love of theUnion grown so cold, that such as this will not  a feeling of indignation andcurl upon for authors oaf  a law  of contempts—Boston F.
