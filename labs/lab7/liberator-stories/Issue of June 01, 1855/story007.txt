 The following Memorial to Congress from citizens andresidents of Kansas in written with great dignity andforce, and gives, undoubtedly, a correct and faithfulaccount of the unparalleled outrages at the late electionin that Territory. It is a document of the utmosthistorical importance, and deserves to find a place, unabridged,in the columns of every journal in the freeStates. 'How any body can read it,' says the SabbathRecorder, 'and not feel his blood boil, we cannot tell.'Yet how apathetic is the North on this subject! SabbathRecorder To the Senate and House of Representatives, in Congressassembled: To the Senate and House of Representatives, in Congressassembled: The memorial of the subscribers, citizens andresidents of the Territory of Kansas, respectfullyrepresents: That a state of things exists in said Territoryunparalleled, as we believe, in the history of ourcountry, and which it becomes our solemn duty tolay before you, and through you before our fellow-citizensof the United States. Under the guarantiesof your law for the organization of this Territory,and in consideration of the privileges whichthat law held out to us, we left our former homes,met the privations of an uninhabited country, andprepared for adding another republic to our Union. law The right of civil and religious liberty—theright of suffrage and self-government—were set upas the beacon lights which beckoned us on. Asfreemen we were united, as freemen we came, andas freemen we expected to live. But we addressyou now as an outraged and subjugated people, disfranchisedand enslaved, stripped of our dearestrights, and governed by a set of masters foreign toour soil, and responsible only to their own lawlesswill. One of the States of our Union, strong in wealth,population and resources relying upon her accumulatedstrength of almost half a century, andtaking advantage of our feeble infancy as a people,has invaded our soil, seized upon our rights, subjugatedour territory and selected for us our rulers,intending also to dictate our laws, and make us theslaves of their will. This may well seem an almostincredible thing, in the Nineteenth Century,and in this Republican Union—the peculiar andboasted land of liberty and self-government—butthe evidence of it is as palpable and undeniable asthe fact is bitter and mortifying to us, and disgraceful to the Republic. This invasion of our soil and usurpation of ourrights commenced at the first moment of callingthose rights into action. The first ballot-box thatwas opened upon our virgin soil was closed to usby overpowering numbers and impending force.It became, not what Americans have been proud todesignate it, the exponent of the people's will, butwas converted into the sword of the oppressor tostrike at civil liberty. So bold and reckless wereour invaders, that they eared not to conceal theirattack. They came upon us, not in the guise of votersto steal away our franchise, but boldly and openlyto snatch it with a strong band. They came directlyfrom their own homes, and in compact andorganized bands, with arms in their bands andprovisions for the expedition, marched to our polls,and when their work was done returned whencethey came. It is unnecessary to enter into the details;it is enough to say that in three districts inwhich, by the most irrefragible evidence, therewere not one hundred and fifty voters, most ofwhom refused to participate in this mockery of theelective franchise, these invaders polled over a thousand votes. Loving our country and its institutions, we werewilling, if this was to be only a solitary instance,to suffer it in silence rather than to proclaim to theworld that even in this remote spot of our greatcountry, civil liberty was but a name. Bitter andmournful experience has taught us, however, thatthis was no isolated act—no temporary ebullition—but the commencement of a well-matured andsettled plan by a large portion of the people of oneof the States of our Union permanently to enslaveus, and constitute themselves our masters. On the 30th day of March last, we were againinvited to the ballot-box, under the law which we,in common with our fellow-citizens of the States,bad through your body enacted. Our vigilant andfaithful Chief Magistrate had surrounded it withall the guards and precautions with which his authorityinvested him, and we were prepared to exercisethe dearest and most cherished privileges ofAmerican citizens with a full sense of the vital andinteresting importance of this peculiar occasion. The occasion came, and with it came our invadingand self-constituted masters in thousands, andwith all the paraphernalia of war. They came,organized in bands, with officers, and arms, andtents, and provisions, and munitions of war, asthough they were marching upon a foreign  insteadof their own unoffending fellow-citizens.Upon the principal road leading into our territory,and passing several important polls, they numberednot less than twelve hundred men, and one campalone contained not less than six hundred.  They arrived at their several destinations thenight before the elections, and having pitched theircamps and placed their sentries waited for the comingday. Baggage-wagons were there with armsand ammunitions enough for a protracted fight, andamong them, two brace field-pieces ready charged.They came with drums beating and flags flying.and their leaders were of the most prominent andconspicuous men of their respective States. In themorning they surrounded the polls armed withguns, bowie-knives and revolvers, and declaredtheir determination to vote at all hazards, and inspite of all consequences. If the Judges could be made to subserve theirpurposes and receive their votes, and if no obstaclewas cast in their way, the leaders exerted themselvesto preserve peace and order in the conductof the election, but at the same time did not hesitateto declare that if not allowed to vote, theywould pressed to say extremity in the destructionof property and life. If control of the polls couldnot be had otherwise, the Judges were by intimidation,and if necessary by violence, prevented fromperforming their duty; or, if unyielding in this respect,were driven from their post and the vacancyfilled, in form, by the persons on the ground; andwhenever by any means they had obtained the controlof the Board, the foreign vote was previouslypassed in without discrimination or reserve,or the slightest care to annual its nefarious illegality. At due of these polls, two of the Judges having up in the face of this armed and declared they would do their duty, one partiesof the mob  to another practiced to  injudges,  shows  with the proclaimedpurposes  who wouldallow himself to be sworn. Voters were dragged the window  they would not showtheir  with the affection of the ,and the invaders declared openly at the polls thatthey would cut the throats of the Judges if theydid not receive their votes without requiring anoath as to their residence.              The room was finally forced, and the Judges surroundedby an armed and excited crowd were offeredthe alternatives of resignation or death, and fiveminutes were allowed for their decision. The ballot-boxwas seized, and amid shouts of Hurrahfor Missouri,' was carried into the mob. The twomenaced Judges then left the ground, together withall the resident citizens except a few who acted inthe outrage, because the result expected from itconformed to their views, and because it enabledthe few to rule the many. When an excess of theforeign force was found to be had at one poll, detachmentswere sent to others where it was supposedthey might be needed. At the polls adjoining the one above alluded to,one of the Judges, a minister of the Gospel, whorefused to accede to the demands of a similar mobof some four hundred armed and organized men,was driven by violence from his post, and the'vacancy' filled by themselves. Threats and violentdemonstrations were rife and another clergyman,for the expression of his opinion, was assaultedand beaten. The inhabitants of the district,powerless to resist the abundant supply of armsand ammunition, the organized preparation andthe overwhelming numbers of these foreigners, leftthe polls without voting. In the Lawrence District, where was the largestcamp of these invaders, speeches were made tothem, by leading residents of Missouri, in which itwas said that they would carry their purposes, ifneed be, at the point of the bayonet and the bowieknife,and one voter war fired at as he was drivenfrom the election ground. Finding they had agreater force than was necessary for that poll, sometwo hundred men were drafted from their number,and sent off under their proper officers to anotherdistrict, after which they still polled from thiscamp over seven hundred votes. In the Fourth and Seventh Districts, along theSanta Fe road, similar scenes were enacted. Theinvaders came together, in one armed and organizedbody, with trains of fifty wagons, besideshorsemen, and the night before election pitchedtheir camp in the vicinity of the polls, and havingappointed their own Judges in place of thosewho, from intimidation or otherwise, failed to attend,they voted without any proof of residence.In these two election districts, where the censusShows one hundred voters there were polled threehundred and fourteen votes, and last fall, sevenhundred and sixty-five votes, although a large portionof the actual residents did not vote upon eitheroccasion. In the Sixteenth Election District,hundreds of men came together as in other cases,crossing the river from Missouri the day beforeelection and encamping together, armed and provisioned,made the fiercest threats against the livesof the Judges, and during the night called severaltimes at the house of one of them for the purposeof intimidating him, declaring, in the presence ofhis wife, that a rope had been prepared to hanghim; and although we are not prepared to say thatthere threats would have been carried out, yet theyserved to produce his resignation, and give theseinvaders, in the substitution, control of the polls;and on the morning of the election, a steamboastbrought from the town of Weston, Missouri, toLeavenworth, an accession to their numbers ofseveral hundred more, who returned in the sameboat, after depositing their votes. There wereover nine hundred and fifty votes polled besidefrom one hundred to one hundred and fifty actualresidents who were deterred or discouraged fromvoting, while the census returns show but threehundred and eighty-five votes in the district amonth later. Not less than six hundred voteswere here given by the non-residents of the Territory,who voted without being sworn as to theirqualifications and immediately after the electionreturned to Missouri—some of them being the incumbentsof important public offices there. Indeed,so well was the character of this foreignvote understood, that the Judges struck out of theprescribed form of return the words 'by lawfulresident voters.' We might continue the list of these sickeningdetails until the blood of every freeman would boilwith indignation, but it is useless. One more instancealone we will refer to. In the EighteenthElection District, where the population was and no great number of foreign votes was nto overpower it, a detachment from Missouri fromsixty to one hundred strong, passed in with a trainof wagons, arms and ammunition, making theircamp, the night before the election, near Moorestown,the place of the polls, without even a ptof residence, and returning immediately toMissouri after their work was done, their leaderand captain being a distinguished citizen of Missouri,but late the presiding officer of the Senate ofthe United States and who had a bowie-knifeand revolver bolted around him, apparently readyto abed the blood of any man who refused to beenslaved. All these facts we are prepared to establish,if necessary, by proof that would be consideredcompetent in a court of justice.   arms  From a careful examination of the returns, weare satisfied that over three thousand votes werethus cast by the citizens and residents of the States,and that a very large portion of the residents weredeterred and discouraged from going to the polls.If this condition of things be allowed to prevail,We are reduced to the state of a vassal provi,And are governed by the State of Missouri.  It would be mere affectation in us to attempt todisguise the fast, that the question of making Kansasa free or slave State is at the bottom of thismovement, and that the men who thus invade oursoil and rob us of our liberties are from the pro-slaverymen of Missouri, who are unwilling to submitthe question to the people of the Territory, andabide the compact between the North and South,which the Kansas Nebraska bill contains. The compact we want carried out, and by thattest we want the question settled if it can be; butthere are few things that we would not preferto the domination of irresponsible invaders fromMissouri. That enactment is not only a law whichStates and individuals are bound to obey, but it isa compact between the North and the South—a solemncovenant between the sovereign States of ourUnion, which none violate without becomingrecreant to the principles of honor and justice—without the betrayal of confidence renamed—withoutthe breaking of plighted faith as in an individualwould lead him to the earth with s andcontempt, and drive him from the society of honestmen. The bill which Northern  hashedwith Northern v had rights is made by men who invade will thevery instrument for privileges, and  them what with  formuch.         That bill, in for them—serfdom for us. The doctrine of self-governmentis to be trampled under foot here, ofall other places in the world, on the very spotwhich had been hallowed and consecrated to itsmost signal vindication. The altars which hadbeen reared to it on this chosen ground, and aroundwhich at least the democracy of the whole Unionhad sworn allegiance, and to which we had comeas pilgrim worshippers in the wilderness, are to beruthlessly demolished. The compact is to be baselybroken, and the ballot of the freeman (in effect)torn from our hands almost before the ink of thecovenant is dry. Not only, too, is the principle ofpopular sovereignty to be blotted out, but, morethan this, even the object of the contest is todisappear. The question of negro slavery is tosink into insignificance, and the great portentousissue is to loom up in its stead whether or not weshall be the slaves, and fanatics who disgrace thehonorable and chivalric men of the South shall beour masters, to rule us at their pleasure.  With a feeble and scattered community, juststruggling into existence, without organization andalmost without shelter, we are powerless to resistan old, strong, and populous State, full of men andarms and resources, and we therefore appeal toyou and through you to the people of the States.Remedy here we have none. Our Executive has, with manly determinationand persistent fidelity, stood by his people, and endeavoredto carry out the principles of popular sovereignty,and secure us the privilege of managingour own affairs and governing ourselves, until hisreputation has been assailed and his life openlythreatened with a bitterness almost unparalleled;and, although as chief magistrate he is all wecould desire, and has fearlessly pursued the pathof duty amid a storm of menace and detraction underwhich many men would have quailed, yet heis powerless-like ourselves. We make now this last appeal, not to the North,not to the South, not to any political party; butto the Representatives of the whole Union. Webeg that no man will sport with our condition byendeavoring to make political capital, or build upparty at the expense of our civil and political existence.We want the men of the North and themen of the South to protect us. Through yourselves,their Representatives, we appeal to theirhonor—to their justice—to their patriotism—totheir sympathies, not for favors, but for rights—notfor trivial rights, but for the dearest rightsguaranteed to us by the Declaration of Independence—by the Constitution of the Union—by thelaw of our organization—by the solemn compact ofthe States, and which you pledged to us as thecondition of our coming here. Communities are not to blame for the conduct oftheir fanatics, unless they sanction them. Wecannot believe that the States of the South willsanction the outraged that have been perpetratedupon us, or will allow them to be continued. Andalthough we might reason the matter as a questionof policy, and show that it is contrary to thelaws of nature and society, and opposed to human experience that good can come from suchevil; although we might prove that it is 'sowingthe wind, and reaping the whirlwind,' and thatthe reaction will be fearful, yet we feel that this isunnecessary; that it is enough to appeal to theirhonor and their sense of justice, and to rely upontheir plighted faith.  Inside our bounds, we shall have no serioustroubles. Northern and Southern men mingle togetherin harmony and good feeling, and in mutualdependence and assistance in the hardships andprivations of a pioneer life. As we learn to understandeach other, friendships are engenderedand prejudices melt away, so that we shall be ableto meet all questions that may arise in a spirit ofjustice and friendly feeling, which will secure therights of all, and cheerful acquiescence in the decisionof the majority. From foreign oppression,however, we ask for relief of that power whichpassed the Kansas bill, and pledged to us its benefitsif we would come here. We have a right toask and do ask its enforcement. It remains foryour honorable bodies to decide whether you willkeep the compact between you and us which existsby that bill and our emigration; whether you willvindicate the sacred doctrines of the Government,or whether you will leave us in a state of vassalageand oppression. We cannot and do not doubt thatyou will in some way give us justice and protection.
