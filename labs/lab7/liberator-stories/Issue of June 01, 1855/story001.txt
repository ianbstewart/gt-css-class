 ☞'Yes! IT CANNOT —the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of their to the Constitution, three special provisions to THE PERPERUNITY OF THESE  over THESESLAVES. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African slave trade the second waslation to  slaves—onengagement positively published by the laws of Go,to the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor SLAVES—for articles of merchandise, underthe name of persons...... in fact, the oppressor representingthe oppressed!.... To call government thus constituteda democracy, is to insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slavery. Its reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of the nation is to establish an artificialmajority in the slave representation over that of thefree people, in the American Congress; AND THEREBYTO MAKE THE PRESERVATION, PROPAGATION AND PERPUTATIONOF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANIMATING SPIRITOF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.—John Quincy Adams.
