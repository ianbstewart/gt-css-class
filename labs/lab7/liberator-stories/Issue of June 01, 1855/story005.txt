 The courage to do right, while all the influencesand trammels of a powerful party organization areholding out inducements to a contrary course, maybe regarded as a nobler example of true manhoodthan the most during act of bravery in battle.When we compare the courageous conduct ofJudge Loring, while acting as United States Commissionerin the case of Burns, with that of GovernorGardner in refusing to accede to the requestof so large a majority of the Legislature to removethe Commissioner from his State office of Judge ofProbate, we are at loss to decide which is mostworthy of the meed of praise. The one, amid thethreats and clamors or an infuriated populace.dured to uphold the supremacy of a national law;the other, selected by the triumphant party ofwhich that populace formed the centre and motiveprinciple as the head of that State Government,has boldly ventured to sustain the dignity andhonor of his State by disregarding the behests ofthose who would put them in jeopardy, for themomentary gratification of an excited feeling.These two cases of moral courage are unequalledby any other which occurs to us in the history ofour Government. They surpass that of JudgeChase in the trial and sentence of Callender, atRichmond; for, though somewhat similar in itscircumstances to those which surrounded JudgeLoring, and though the feeling was deep and apparentlymenacing, the danger to Judge Chase wasnot as great as his friends alleged, and the characterof the excited crowd which filled the hall atRichmond forbade the idea of personal violence;still the scene was enough to try the Judge'snerves, but he executed his sacred office with astern defiance of the popular feeling—which, youngas we were, we fully partook of—in a mannerwhich, we well remember, commanded the admirationof many who most condemned its exercise. The only instance of moral courage that weknow of, in the history of our country, which canjustly be compared with the heroism of the twoindividuals in question is also a Boston case—thatof John Adams, who, though a leading and mostardent member of the popular party, undertook todefend Captain Preston and his soldiers when indictedfor firing upon the citizens of Boston.Against the advice of his friends, and at all hazardof losing all-favor with the revolutionary party, heboldly stepped forward and gave the British soldiersthe benefit of his professional service to screenthem from the vengeance of an enraged people. Itis well known that, so far from lessening his influencewith the people whose heated passions hethus defied, the bold honesty with which he defendedwhat he believed to be an act of pare self-defensewon for him a higher degree of favor thanever. And so will it be with Governor Gardnerand Judge Loring. When the excitement of themoment shall have passed away, and calm reflectionshall have once more recovered its home inthe minds of the men of Massachusetts, thesenames will be honored by them as illustrations ofhonest devotion to truth, justice, and duty.
