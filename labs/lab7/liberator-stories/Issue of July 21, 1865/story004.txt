 The following extract from a letter written byGen. B.F. .Butler recently, presents a few strikingsuggestions upon the all-important subject of Reorganization:â€” "I most firmly believe that President Johnsonwill do in this matter what is right and best.

In another State the tories were receivedinto fellowship, and their property largely givesback to them. The result has been that the countryhas had two States with dissimilar institutions,Massachusetts and South Carolina. Which do youprefer as a pattern for the regenerate South?Without confiscation, Sooth Carolina? With confiscation,Massachusetts?" tories tories
