 In his oration at Chicago on the 4th of July,Hon. Henry Winter Davis, of Maryland, took radicaland right grouped upon the question of negro suffrage.He said:— "We need the votes of all the colored people;it is numbers, not intelligence, that counts at theballot box—it is the right intention, not the philosophicjudgment, that casts the vote. (Applause.)More glorious still would it be for Congress to followthe great example we have just had of abolishingslavery by an amendment of the Constitution.Let them pass by their two-thirds majority, in bothhouses of Congress, an amendment of the Constitutionsecuring forever the mass of the people as thebasis of the republican government of the UnitedStates, and submit it this very coming winter, beforethe legislatures adjourn, for their information.(Applause.) And when it shall have received theassent of three-fourths of those now recognized asStates and represented in Congress, let Congressinstantly proclaim it as the fundamental law of theland, valid and binding as the Constitution itself, ofwhich they will thus have made it a part, underwhich they sit; which no State Caprice, no questionof political parties, nothing in the future, exceptthe triumph of slavery over free institutions,can ever shake or call in question. (Applause.)Then all the proclamations of the Declaration ofIndependence will be executed; this governmentwill rest on the rights of individual liberty, and theright of every man to bear a share in the governmentof the country whose laws he obeys, and whosebayonet in the hour of danger he bears. And thepersonal freedom which the dark children of the republichave won by our blood and theirs will not bea vain mockery, exposed to violation at the capriceof their masters, enthroned in the legislature, onthe bench and in the executive chamber, but, securedby the bayonet they hold and the ballot theycast, will be liberty guarded by power."
