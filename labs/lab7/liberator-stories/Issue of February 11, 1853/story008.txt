 BELCHERTOWN, Feb. 5, 1853. ELCHERTOWN, MR. GARRISON: R. ARRISON: DEAR SIR,—I requested a friend in Boston to leavescopy of my recent 'Election Sermon' at your office, and now learn that it was noticed at some length in in your paper of the 21st alt, which I have just seen, and a copy of which I would like.

I hardly know of an event in our polotical history which seems to me fraught with more instructive moral lessons.  My 'theological creed' from probably be inferred from incidental allusions and remarks in the discourse;but I am sure that it is nowhere offensively introduced.  I expressed on the occasion, on every topic, just what was demanded by fidelity to my own convictions of truth and duty—the only merit which the Sclaim.  Yours respectfully, SAMCEL WOLCOTT
