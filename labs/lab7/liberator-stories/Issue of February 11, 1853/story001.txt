 GENTLEMEN:  that one of the greatest obstacles in our way moment is a tendency to discouragement; tendency results from the fact that our little larger to-day, after twenty years of preserving effort, than they were at the comof the great movement       There is in this fact,—for I am free to confess—enough to discourage minds that have not thoroughly and carefully the philosophy of that we should have worked so long and aroundyet have made so few additional converts, are made no more than we have lost,—for numbers are not materially larger to-day twenty years ago, it is not true that we converts, for our ranks have been thinefficient causes, death and defection,—and has probably taken two where the former—so that we have accomplished some matter of multiplying converts to keep our But the fact that we have done no more direction is, in itself, calculated to discourage and lead them to think, that if our success been so small in this respect, there is little hope that we shall ever succeed in brining the the position which our cause requires it to                    apprehend that this feeling of discouragement to be based on a false philosophy, or rath from want of knowledge of the true philosophymovement. For one, I do not consider it that our numbers should ever be materially in and I very much doubt whether, when the free, when the final result of our entered fully achieved, there will be any considernumber more standing with us than there are toit is not need more. All we need is fidelity to on the part of those already engaged in the and TIME for its achievement. It is a prin physiology, that every plant must have and it is in vain for you to attempt to fruit. You may subject it to the best possession you may put on to your garden any number and multiply them to any extent, you and enrich the soil to any possible degree—for by a law of nature, the plant re and time it will have, before it will yield labor you must have. A certain amount of is useful in the production of fruit, but this and all beyond is to no purpose                       we are engaged in a great and glorious revolution which,—it matters not how manymanage in it,—requires time to mature. If the were a physical one, every thing would de numbers, and the more hands, the quicker the paid to be done. If our numbers were large enough,and much against the hosts of slavery, and beat at once. But this is not our object. Our to overthrow slavery by the regeneration of. We seek not a bloody, but a peaceful and this can be brought about only by a and entire revolution in the thoughts, feel and aims of the American people. Our are to be educated into a love of liberty. They do not possess that love now, never did. In the war of the Revolution, not possess it; they loved liberty for them love that burns in every tyrant's bosom,—it intently, so intently that they said, our bosoms to the cannon's mouth, we wives widows, and our children orphas, bequenth to them the inheritance of a des shall dare to tax them even to the extent of pound on their tea., t is something to our ancestors, that they loved liberty for I wish I could say as much of the present much of the living sons of New England, as of Bt we have not even this love of we have sadly degenerated from our parent in these dark and degenerate days, even of liberty is a thing to be respected, and we my honors to our venerated ancestors; but of liberty, let it be remembered, extended; they loved it not as a principle; it them a selfish feeling                                   not the love of liberty we inculcate. It is work to bring back the present generation to stood. That would be a great work, require time; but we lay deeper and broader of liberty. We seek to inspire the love as a principle in the American bosom, and laying the foundations of freedom, not for a, but for the whole family of man. We a movement, and have prosecuted it years, which is destined in its consummation the whole human family. It will never be and I trust it will never stop, until it down the last form of despotism that courses.                been surprising to many that the Chruch found against us, when all her preaching seem to require that she should embrace anddecrease  and that trade and commerce, and of the North, even, should present an to our movement. The reason why are arrayed against it is, because all unsanctioned and selfish in spirit. The pulpit was once the defender of liberty, our led from the despotism of the Church of Englandand planted and standard of religious liberty on. And so with trade and politics. Both the war of the Revolution. But the liberty was sought and established by these variousin  was selfish and unjust. It was not based on the principle which lies at the foundation of the scheme, the principle of impartial love of brotherhood. Trade, politics, religion, every American except the anti-slavery movement, is and selfish. Henoc they can flourish in soil, and greater support for a cherishedeven from the vices of the community. But notso with us; our enterprise seeks to rear the temple ofliberty on the principle of lover; and as love is impartialand universal, we necessarily find arrayed againstus every thing which is spirit is either local, sectional,or sectarian. Hence you find against us Church andState; every thing that is unsanctified in spirit is foundrising in our pathway. Our work is to revolutionizethe whole. We are to destroy not the chattel principleonly—we have not merely to break off the chains andfetters from the limbs of three millions of slaves, butto eradicate the selfish principle from twenty millions ofhearts. This is a work which requires TIME. It mattersnot to what extent you multiply the laborers, itcannot be done in a day. I do not believe in instantaneousregeneration. I did so believe once, but experiencehas taught me better, and I have expurgated frommy philosophy the doctrine that the mind can be renovatedin a day. The change may, and, of course doescommence in a moment; but for a man to think of passingfrom the lowest depths of hell to the upper seat inheaven at a single leap is absurd, at variance with everyprinciple of human nature, and with all our experience                     The growth of a moral principle is like the growth ofa tree; it admits of cultivation, and will be helped by it,but it requires time for its development and perfection,and there is such a thing as stimulating it into an unhealthygrowth. Our cause requires time. Then donot let us be discouraged because it does not grow morerapidly. All we have to do is to see that the truth ofGod is clearly and distinctly held up before the people.That done, all is sone that can be done and it matternot how few or many are engaged in this work, whetherthat truth be blazoned forth by ten or ten thousand,so that the nation sees it. In time, it will have its legitimateaction, and work out its legitimate results onthe national conscience. I know there are certain results that can be effectedby the multiplication of numbers; we may, by bringingthousands into this city to attend these meetings, affectthe coming elections. But remember, this is not ourwork. Our work is with the conscience, and merenumbers never yet purified a human heart, never reallyenlightened a human intellect. ourwork. I know it is necessary in our movement, if we wouldhasten it, to have teachers enough to keep the truthdistinctly before the whole people; yet these we havenot at present. The augmentation of our numberswould undoubtedly increase the progress of our cause,because it would enable us to put the light beforemore minds. There are many yet in ignorancecapable of beholding the light, if it could only be letinto the dark corners in which they dwell But, after all, I apprehend that we are not sodeficient in labourers as some seem to suppose. We musthave time for any enterprise to mature, and this isrequisite whether the laborers be few or many. And evenif we are greatly deficient in laborers, we have no causefor discouragement; for we have only to take a littlemore time, and those already in this warfare will beable to accomplish all that could be accomplished by alarger number in less time. I have no feeling of discouragementin my bosom. Even if I knew we couldnot succeed, my course would be still the same. Godnever predicated the condition of my happiness on mysuccess. If I do the work which He has given me to do,to the best of my ability, I shall have done my part,and though I do not succeed, it is not my fault. Theresults are not mine, and I feel that in the end, whateverthey may be, I shall have my reward. So, if I knewthat we should fail, I should feel that a great goodwould be accomplished by our efforts,—a good for thecoming ages. If but one HONEST man should live inthe nineteenth century, he would not live in vain. Ithink, therefore, even granting that our cause is not tosucceed, that we should not, for a moment, cherish afeeling of discouragement But we SHALL succeed. Our success thus far hasbeen all that we could expect, under the circumstancesThere never was before such success attending humaneffort; never did the public sentiment move on sorapidly. I am amazed at the progress of my own mind,when I took back over the past, and see where I stoodtwenty years ago, when the anti-slavery enterprisepicked me up, and contract it with the position inwhich I stand to-day. I have myself been sufficientlybenefited to warrant all the sacrifices that have beenmade in this casue. The man that plucks a brandfrom the burning, that liberates a human soul fromthe galling chains of spiritual despotism, that disenthrallsthe immortal spirit, and turns that spirit, freedrom the tormenting fear of death and more tormentingfear of hell, to the Infinite God, that it maymore and more expand under His pure and holy influence;—hewho does that, does a great and gloriouswork, and that work, I feel the anti-slavery movementhas done for me, and not for me alone, but for thousandsand tens of thousands of other minds. We haveliterally experienced in this movement the declarationof Jesus, made eighteen hundred years ago, that 'itis more blessed to give than to receive.' We have beenendeavoring to give liberty to the slave. In that wehave not yet succeeded, but we have been liberated ourselvesfrom a despotism more horrible than the mereoutward despotism which crushes the broken-heartedslave in his chains. Our spirits have been set free—freein the practical, the highest, the holiest sense ofthat word; and that freedom which has been conferredupon us has prepared us for the great work of goingforth to liberate other minds The man who looks at the slave only, and at our enterpriseas connected with his physical emancipation,—Iwonder not that such should think our cause movesslowly, that he should wonder we meet yearunder existing circumstances. But he who views it inthis light has no adequate comprehension of its truedignity and scope. I know that was the mission on whichwe started, but it is not to be the only result of ourlabors; for in freeing the slave from his shackles, we areliberating the mind of the whole community; we arelaying deeper and broader the foundations of humanfreedom than they were never intended to be laid by anyother class of men, in any age of the world. We are,if effect, striking at despotism of every description,and with the downfall of slavery, there will come thedownfall of the despotism of Church and State Throughoutthe country, an eventually throughout world. I have regretted that our causes had so many obstaclesto contend with; that the church, at the beginningour movement, should have thrown herself across ourpath; that Northern politics should be so hostile. ButI regret it no longer; for with our triumph, these despotisms,spiritual and political, will pass away. I donot say that the form of our religion will disappearwith the form of slavery: the church may exist in formfor many years to come, but the spirit is rapidly takingits departure, and she will soon be a powerless thoughsomewhat offensive body. My object in these remarks is to cheer up the friendsof the slave. There is, my friends, no causes for discouragement,under any circumstances. We are engagedin a warfare which, to my mind, is certain ofsuccess, If there be a single man to go forth to thebattle. Look back twenty years, and there stood one man,single-handed and alone,—a printer's boy, friendless,penniless, without education, without any thing tocommend him to the world,—an the note of admonitionfrom his solitary lips rang like thunder through thiswhole land, and it so agitated the slaveholder in hisgorgeous palace, that he instantly offered a reward of$5000 to any one that would silence that young voicein death. Such was the potency of a human voice,—humanvoice, did I say? no! the potency was not in thevoice, for other voices had spoken in kindred tones,—thatpotency was in the pulsations of the heart. Thepotency of a true heart, what can it not do? It canmake itself felt all over the world; like electricity, itwill find itself a connecting medium, and go far andwide to earth's remotest bounds. In this is our hope,not in numbers; and so long as there is a single man orwoman with a true heart, so long there shall be nopeace to the slaveholder, and our cause shall continueto triumph; and just in proportion to the earnestness ofour spirit will be the success of our movement. Then, friends, do not let us be discouraged; do notlet us count our numbers; let our trust be in the livingGod—not theologically, but practically; let it be in thegreat principles of truth and justice: let us resolve toexemplify them in our own characters. Let there bebut one living soul in this nation, whose voice shallbe true and clear and distinct for liberty, and the nationwill all hear and all read, and in due time, every heartwill be brought under its divine and all-pervading influence.Let us resolve, then, to go onward, every mantrimming his lamp and letting his light so shine beforethe world, that others, seeing his good works, may bedrawn to unite in this great and glorious enterprise!
