 THE U.S.CONSTITUTION IS 'A CONVENANT WITH DEATHAND AN AGREEMENT WITH HELL. ☞'Yes! IT CANNOT BE DENIED—the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of theirassent to the Constitution, three special provisions TOSECURE THE PERPITUITY OF THEIR DOMINION OVER THEIRSLAVES. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African Slave trade; the second wasTHE STIPULATION TO SURRENDER FUGITIVE SLAVES—anengagement positively prohibited by the laws of God,delivered from Signal; and, thirdly, the exaction, fatalto the principles of popular representation, of arepresentation for SLAVES—for articles of merchandise, underthe name of persons . . . . . in fact, the oppressor representingthe oppressed! . . . To call government thus constituted ademocracy, is to insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slavery. Its reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of nation is to establish an artificialmajority in the slave representation over that of thefree people, in the American Congress; AND THEREBYTO MAKE THE PRESERVATION, PROPAGATION ANDPERPUTATION OF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANIMATING SPIRITOF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMNET.'—John Quincy Adams.
