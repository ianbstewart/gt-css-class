 In Kentucky, organizations have been made forgrating to Califor, and a 'California EmigratingSociety' is established. Farther North thetious will be created, to move into thenew territory arud bands of slaveholders. ThePhlphia Republic says, with truth and force:—[Albany Atlas.      The slaveholders know what they are about.Their deadly resistance to the Proviso is not anabstraction, and accordingly we find them organizingColonization Societies for the purpose of occupyingthe ground and arraying their forces onthe spot for the earliest and most desperate effortsto extend their system into the new country. It isto be occupied as Texas was, and for the same persons.All they want is done to crowd the landwith their slaves. The invasion is already arranged,and while the North is debating whether theProviso is necessary, and whether Taylor willveto it, the propagats are busy pushing forwardtheir nefarious enterprise. It is not a non-committal,unfledged President that will arrest themischief. Delay decisive legislative action as longas the Oregon bill was hanging in Congress, andthe question will be one of abolition at slavery,which, by that time, will have ud the ground,and planted itself upon the right of possession.Actual, absolute, immediate prohibition—the WilmotProviso now, is the only security: every pretenceand profession that delays the decision is acheat. The annexation of Texas was accomplishedby steah. When Adams and G, andone or two other members of Congress, first warnedthe country of the design, it seemed so impossiblethat it was unheaded, but within a year ortwo from the time when the purpose was demonstrated,the scheme had trimph over all obstacles,and the iniquity was consummated.'
