 A victim of your power and oppression humblycraves your attention a few words In behalf ofhimself and three millions of his brethren whomyou hold in attain and slavery) with respect as theelection just completed. In doing so, I desire tobe regarded as addressing you individually and collectively.'It I should seem severe remember thatthe iron of slavery has pierced and rankled in myheart, and that I not only smart under the recollectionof a long and cruel enslavement, but an evennow passing my life in a country, and among a peoplewhose prejudices against myself and peoplesubject me to a thousand poisonous stings. If Ispeak harshly, my excuse is, that I speak in fettersof your own forging. Remember that oppressionboth the power to make even a wise man mad. In the selection of your national rulers, just completed,you have male another broad mark on thepage of your nation's history, and have given tothe would and the coming generation a certain testby which to determine your present integrity as apeople. That actions speak founder than words—that within the character of the representative maybe seen that of the constituency—that no peopleare better than their laws or law-makers—that astream cannot rise higher than its source—that asweet fountain cannot sent forth bitter waters,and that a tree is to be known by his fruits, aretruisms; and in their light let us examine the characterand pretensions of your boasted Republic. As a people, you claim for yourselves a highercivilization—a purer morality—a deeper religiousfaith—a larger love of liberty, and a broader philanthropy,than any other nation on the globe. Ina word, you claim yours to be a model Republic,and promise, by the force and excellence of yourinstitutions, and the purity and brightness of yourexample, to overthrow the thrones and despotismsof the old world, and institute your own in theirstead. Your missionaries, are found in the remotestparts of the party, while your land swarms withchurches and religious institutions. In words ofReligion an Liberty, you are abundant and preeminent.You have long desired to get rid of theodium of being regarded as pro-slavery, and haveeven insisted that the charge of pro-slavery madeagainst you was a slander, and that those who madein were actuated by a wild and fanatical spirit. Tomost of your innocence appear, you have now had afair community. The issue of freedom or slaveryhas been clearly submitted to you, and you havedeliberately chosen slavery. General Taylor and General Cass were the chosenand admitted southern and slavery candidatesfor the Presidency. Martin Van Buren, thought farfrom being an abolitionist, yet in some sort representedthe anti-slavery idea of the North, in a politicalform—but you have rejected, and elected aslaveholder to rule over you in hi stead. Whenthe question was whether New Mexico and Californiashall be free or slave States, you have rejectedhim who was solemnly pledge to maintain theirfreedom, and have chosen a man whom you knewto be pledged, by his position, to the maintenanceof slavery. By your votes, you have said that slaveryis better than freedom—that war is better thanpeace, and that cruelty in better than humanity,You have given your sanction to slave rule andslavery propagandism, and interposed whatever ofmoral character and standing you possess, to shieldthe reputation of slaveholders generally. You havesaid, that to be a man-stealer is no crime—to trafficin human flesh shall be a passport, rather than abarrier, to your suffrages. To slaveholders youhave said. Chain up you men and women, and beforethe bloody lash drive them to new fields oftoil in California and New Mexico. To the slavein his chains you have said, Be content in yourchains, and if you dare to gain your freedom byforce, whether in New Mexico or California, innumbers indicated by our votes our muskets shallfind you out. In a word, you have again renewedyour determination to support the Constitution ofthe United States, in its parts of freedom to thewhites and slavery to the blacks. If General Taylorslaves run away, you have prod again toreturn them to bondage. While General Tayloris the well-known robber of three hundred humanbeings of all their hard earnings, and is coiningtheir hard earnings into gold, you have conferredupon him an office worth twenty-five thousand dollarsa year, and the highest honor in your power.By this act you have endorsed his character andHistory. His murders in Mexico—his bloodhound'cruelty in the Florida war—his awful profanitytogether with the crunes attendant upon a slaveplantation, such as their, robber, murder and adultery,you have sanctioned as perfectly consistentwith your morality, humanity, liberty, religion andcivilization. You have said that the most availableand suitable person in all this great nation, to presaleover this model Republic, is a warrior, slaveholderswearer, and bloodhound importer. Duringthe campaign just ended your leaders havedubbed this man-stealer as an honest man, and manyof you have shouted over the LIE as being a truth,thus destroying all moral distinctions. To talk ofa veracious far, a pious blasphemer, a righteousrobber, a candid by pocrite, a sober drunkard, or ahuman criminal, would be quite as just and regionalas to call and admitted man-stealer an honestman. Yet, in the wildness of a wicked enthusiasm,you have given your countenance and supportto this.  honest man Now, is it too much to say that you have madehis crimes your own, and that the blood of theslave is on your garments? You have covered histheft with honesty, his blasphemy with piety, and,as far as in your power, you have rendered theblows intended to destroy slavery nugatory and innoxious.Before high Heaven and the world, youare responsible for the blood of the slave. Youmay shut your eyes to the fact, sport over it, sleepover it, but so sure as there is a God of Justice andan unerring Providence, just so sure will the bloodof the bondman be required at your hands. Anopportunity was presented to you by which youcould have fixed and indelible mark of your utterdetestation of slavery, and given a powerful blowto that bitter cures. This you have failed to do.When Christ and Brabbas were presented, youhave cried out in your , Give us Burabbs,the robber, in preference to Christ, the innocent.The perishing slave, with uplifted hands an bleedingheart, implored you, in the name of the Godyou profess to serve, and the humanity you professto cherish, not to add this mill-stone to the weightalready crushing his heart and hopes. But he hasappointed in vain. You have turned a deaf our tohis cries, hundred your hearts to his appeal, turnedyour back upon his sorrows, and united withthe tyrant to perpeate his enslavement. The effortsmade in your presence to impress you withthe awful sin of slavery, and to awaken you to asense of your duty to the oppressed, have thus farbeen unavailing. You continue to fight againstGod, and declare that injustice exclaimed a nation,and that sin is an honor to any people.     injustice exclaimed honor Do you really think to circumvent ? Doyou suppose that you can, go on in  amountcurour of injustice and political prodi? He the law of righteous  he inrepeated from the statutes of the Al Owhat mean  the; ye brain and bind any people?Will justice sleep for ever? O that you would laythese things to ! O that you would considerthe enormity of your conduct, and such at the hands of a  Creator! Request of this and bring  fruit  for by delivering the  out of the of the                   You may thoughts that you have now attendedthe annoying coy of abolition—that you have realizedthe deem of the slave—that abolition is and dead; but you will find you mistake. Youhave  but the cause is not dead. Though and bleeding at your fear, she shall riseagain, and going before you, shall give you no resttill you break every yoke and let the oppressed gofree. The anti-slavery societies, of the land willrise up and spring to action again, sending forthfrom the press, and on the voice of the livingspeaker, words of burning truth to slave the guilty,in unmask the hypocrite to expose the founds ofpolitical parties, and rebuke the spirit of a corruptand  sustaining church and clergy. Slavery willbe attacked in its strong —the compromises ofthe Constitution and the cry of discussion shall bemorn  proclaimed, till slavery be abolishedthe Union dissolved, or the sun of this guiltynation go down in blood.    speaker
