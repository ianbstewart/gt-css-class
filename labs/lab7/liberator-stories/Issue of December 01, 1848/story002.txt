 The people of the whole country who are opposedto Slavery, should, for the next four years,sleep on their arms, and keep their slow-matchesburning. We ask the attention of our readers to the following.Read it for benefit in the future. It waswritten by the Hon. Charles Hudson, of Massachusetts,in April, 1847: But Slavery is never at rest. THE SOUTHARE DETERMINED TO KEEP THE REINSIN THEIR OWN HANDS, it possible; and seeingthe growing popularity of General Taylor theyhave thought it a favorable opportunity TO FORCEANOTHER SLAVEHOLDER UPON THEWHIG PARTY. We do not believe that theWhig party at the South, as such, have any suchdesign among them have this at heart. No itreason for the North to any whether they will beso dazzled with the glory acquired in an unjustwar, as to be cheated out at their rights, and beput into the hands at another slaveholding President.The present war has grown out of Slavery,and whether it continues till the next Presidentcourse into office, or whether it has terminated beforeby the acquisition of territory, it will be of vitalconsequence to the North, whether the Presidentbe a slaveholder, or a man opposed to thatinstitution. I this war, commenced to foster thatinstitution should continue, we want a man at thehead of our affairs who will no sacrifice thousandsof lives an millions of money to carry on the warfor such an inglorious purpose; and if peace ismade, and we acquire a large portion of territory,we want an Executive who will insist that that territoryshall not be cursed with slavery. LET THEFREEMEN OF THE NORTH LOOK WELLTO THIS. AND IF THEY DESIRE TOHAVE OUR GOVERNMENT DEVOTED TOTHAT INHUMAN INSTITUTION FOURYEARS MORE, LET THEM CHIME INWITH CERTAIN WIRE PULLERS ATTHE SOUTH, and ADVOCATE THE NOMINATIONOF GENERAL TAYLOR. Let themremembers that a new paper has been started atWashington, under the auspices of certain slaveholdinggentlemen, and those devoted to their interest,to aid the cause of the hero of Buena Vista, andthat no pains will be spared in Tennessee, in Kentucky,in Virginia, and other Southern States tobring the Whig party into that nomination. Let theNorthern Whigs look wall to this; and if they havehalf the watchfulness that their Southern friendspossess, they will at once enter their protest againstSuch a measure. THE NORTH HAVE BEENRULED BY THE SOUTH LONG ENOUGH.It is time that the majority should rule. A nationboasting of free institutions has already shed blondand wasted treats a enough, to sustain an institutionat war with the first principles of our Constitution.We have felt the iron heal of slavery longenough, one would think, to induce us to asset ourrights and to act like freemen. CHIME INWITH CERTAIN WIRE PULLERS ATTHE SOUTH, and ADVOCATE THE NOMINATIONOF tobring the Whig party into that nomination. they will at once enter their protest againstSuch a measure.
