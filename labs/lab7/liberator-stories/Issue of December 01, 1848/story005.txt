 We understand that the Orthodox Quakers generallyand a great proportion of the members ofthe Hksite division, voted for Brigadier GeneralZachary Taylor, of the United States army; the! hero of he Mexican war, the officer bywhose advice the United states army was orderedform Corpus Christ to the Rio Grande; and thewar with Mexico begun—by whose advice and urgentrequest, bloodhounds, were imported intoFlorida to hunt the Indians; the Louisiana slaveholderand slave-buyer; the chosen instrument ofthe slave holders to preserve and extend slavery;as their candidate for the presidency. Thesepeaceful followers of George Fox and WilliamPenn, the men who canonize John Woolman, EdwardBurroughs, Anthony Benezet, and WarnerMfllm, have publicly declared themselves fullyrepresented by the warrior of Buena Vista, andLouisiana slaveholder, whose only experience isin the discipline of the slave plantation, and theart of human slaughter, and whose only laurels arestained with human blood. Yet these men have'testimonies,' against slavery and war and militarypreparations, and the bearing of arms, and sorigid are they, that a member of their society layshimself liable to discipline and expulsion, for eitherperforming military service or paying a militaryfine, though non-payment would subject himto a great pecuniary loss. No excuses of policyor apparent advantage will justly, in their eyes,either of these volitions of principle. Are theytoo blind to see how they are thus sowing tares intheir own wheat-field, encouraging the martialspirit, and admiration for the achievements of thewarrior, and thus more than neutralizing all theirpacific lessons, and making slaveholding a reputablebusiness instead of an odious crime, and thusencouraging the slaveholder, and offering a bountyfor others to imitate his tyranny?    While they exalt the slaveholder and slave-buyerto the highest political honors, and bestowthe richest rewards upon military exploits, of whatworth are all their sermons and 'testimonies' and'queries'? Men get their impressions of truthand virtue more from practical examples thanfrom theoretical instructions, and no words ofpeace of freedom can prevent the fatal influenceof this practical commendation of war anti-slavery.It is worse than destroying with one hand what isreared with the other; it not only sweeps awaythe good their won hands had constructed, buttears up the very foundation on which othersmight build. It disturbs all faith in moral principle. It is not alone that the warrior and tyrant issuccessful, and secures, the highest pinnacle of politicalambition, but his supporters will, of course,attempt a defence of their own action, in whichthey must apologize for the blackest crimes of theage, and eulogize their perpetrator as a paragon ofvirtue and manly excellences. We cannot imagineaction and teaching more directly demoralizingto those who practice and to those who witnessit. While the wise and accomplished statesman,and the true patriot and philanthropist, areleft in obscurity, the bloody warrior and petty despotis elevated to supreme power, and coveredwith fulsome praise. While the advocates of politicalreturns, for freedom and brotherly love, arespurned and repulsed the man-slaver and man-enslaveris welcomed and glorified. From avowed fighters and pro-slavery men, weexpect nothing better, but he evil in this case isgreatly aggravated by the moral standing, respectability,and high professions of those who engage init. They may rejoice for their success as Whigs,but they may mourn for their shameful defeat asFriends. They may secure a financial policywhich will increase their wealth, and give an impetusto the greedy scramble of trade, but it is at afearful cost to morality and pure religion, by a sadviolence to their own hearts. It would be easy forany one to see how the election of notoriouscounterfeiter or burglar, (whose only  wasfrom success in his crimes,) to the Presidency,must demoralize the nation, and pro not onlythe peculiar crimes he had practiced, but all formsof vice and wickedness. Why it is less apparent this care? The political economist may mournfor the election of ignorant and incompetent rulers,but it is a trifling evil, compared to the electionof immoral once. The moral bearings of anelection are always more important than its economical,and it is greatly to be regretted that thistruth I so seldom heeded. The Quakers wereonce foremost in their perception of it, and in theirpractical fidelity to Christians morality; but 'howhas the fine gold become dim!' 'How is thefaithful city because a !
