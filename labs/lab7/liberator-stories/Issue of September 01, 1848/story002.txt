 Two Conventions have recently been held at SenecaFalls and Rochester, which, though waking upsome wrong feeling among the 'lords of creation,'have nevertheless aimed a blow at prevailing despoticusages, which will be effective in assigning toWoman her just position in society. Proof wasabundantly submitted at these Conventions of woman'sequality with man, exploding the absurd dogmaof her incapacity to take care of herself. Presumingthe proceedings will find place in the Liberator,I forbear further comments. W.C.N. Rochester, Aug 14, 1848
