 The advice by the as the the opinion we have been  to the and the result of the  movement inIreland. It is  and and most of the other head was made against the government forces, andthe preparations of the insurgents appear to havebeen as imperfect and insufficient as these of thegovernment were complete and thoroughly appointed.It was a most hopeless affair,—and a hopeless insurrection,especially when a deliberate and not asudden one, is a very wicked thing. Fur it disturbsthe peace and happiness of a nation, sad endangersthe lives sad liberties of impulsive and imperfectlyinformed people, with so justifying prospect of anybeneficial result. We do not believe that the YoungIreland leaders had say design originally of bringingabout the slate of things in which they have justfound themselves. But they played with edge-tools,and have eat their fingers. They talked about fighting,and were taken at their word. And when thetime of fighting came, they found that armies are notraised, disciplined, provisioned and maitioned bytalk. And fighting bring new reduced to an exacscience, there was nothing left for them but to givein.          We are sorry for these Hotspurs who have gotthemselves into this scrape, and heartily wish themwell out of it. AS to the American Sympathizers,said to be under arrest, they will receive but littlesympathy in return for that they went to show.They are only a grade better than the patriots, Irishand American, who stay quietly in this country, andtry to fin the fires of a bungling rebellion, and manufacturelying news to extort a few more farthingsfrom the excitable emigrants from-Ireland. And weare sorry for this vain attempt, because it will retardthe day of such red roe and amelioration as Englishlegislation can afford, it must come, but whathas happened neither produces the state of thingsnor the slate of mind, to hasten it. But though therebellion is crushed for the time being, the discontentswhich underlie the heaving masses remain.The volcano may be quiet, but the central firesare still at work. There is no cure for mis-government,but good government,—no remedy for injustice,but justice. Three things the Irish must andwill have, in the same proportion at least as theirfellow-subjects of Great Britain. But the way toachieve them is that indicated by the great O'Connell.Unarmed, peaceful agitation, acting on publicopinion, and through public opinion on Parliamentis the certain weapon of this victory. It is a Weaponwhich spikes cannon and turns aside the edge of thesword. No army is a match for it. No governmentcon resist it.—Q.
