 WARRINGTON, Eng., Jan. 11, 1858. ARRINGTON MY DEAR SIR,â€”You and all our friends will beglad to hear of the safe arrival of the Rev. S.J. May of Syracuse, and Miss Sarah P.Remond, had a very severe timeof it. Sickness continued her constant attendant thewhole voyage. But she is now at my house, ,I hope, her strength for labor in the good which has brought her here. She has not come she was wanted. It is a very difficult thing to getEnglishmen to believe the facts of the awful of all moral and religious feeling on the subjectof slavery in America. Several of my own friendswould not believe the case of Rev. Samuel Green, whowas sentenced to ten years imprisonment in Maryland,for having a copy of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin in hispossession. No European despot durst have done sucha monstrously tyrannical act. Y EAR IR     would not believe I merely give you this as a specimen of the state offeeling here, and how much we want enlightening asto the facts of the present conditions of the slaveryquestion on this side the Atlantic. I hope by and byto have a little more time or strength, which with meis pretty nearly the same thing, to do something ofthe work I determined on before I left Boston, andwhich though deferred, is constantly before mymind. With kind regards to you, II. C. Wright, and all my anti-slavery friends, believe me, Yours very truly, ROBSON
