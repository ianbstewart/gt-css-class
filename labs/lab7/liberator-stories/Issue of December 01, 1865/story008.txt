 The following letter from President Lincoln,written before he was nominated for the Paradise,has just beau brought to light: DR. THEDORE CANISIUS: R. HEDORE ANISIUS: DEAR SIRâ€”Your note, asking, in behalf yourselfill and other German citizen, whether I am for oragainst the Constitutional provision is regard tonaturalized citizen lately adopted by Massachusetts,and whether I am for or against a fusion of the Republicansand other opposition elements for the convenesof 1860, is received, EAR IR Massachusetts is a sovereign and independentState, and it is no privilege of mine to scolds her forwhat she does. Still, if tram what aha has done aninference is sought to be drawn as to what I would do,I may, without impropriety, speak out. I say, then,that, as I understand the Massachusetts proven,I am against in adoption is Illinois, or is any otherplace where I have a right to oppose it.. Understandingthe spirit of our institutions to aim at theelevation of men, I am opposed to whatever tendsto degrade them. I have some little notoriety for commiseratingthe appeased condition of the negro; andI should us strangely inconsistent if I could toany project for curtailing too existing rights ofwhite men, even though born is different leads, andspeaking deferent languages from myself. As to the matter of fusion, I am for it, if it canbe had on Republican ground, and I am not far it onsay other terms. A fusion on say other termswould be as foolish as unprincipled, k would losethe whole Worth, white the common enemy wouldnull carry the whole South. The question of menis a different one. There art good patristic menand able statesmen is the South, whom I wouldcheerfully support, if they would now place themselvesupon ground ground. But I am agitatedletting down the Republican standard a heir'sbreadth. I have written this hastily but I believe it answersyour question substantially Your truly, A. LINCOLN.
