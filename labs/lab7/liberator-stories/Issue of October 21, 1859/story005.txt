 Mr. Yeadon styled Mr. Everett 'the great laudator'of Washington. Wendell Phillips may becalled the great vilifier in general. One of the dailypapers attributes his periodical overflow of bile tomonomania, but the man is not mad yes. What bemay come to, it would not be safe to predict. Hegave the opening lecture last week, in a course atBoston, on no subject in particular, and everythingin general, the hour being spent in spitting uponevery body and every thing, but the little clique ofmutual admirers to which Garrison, TheodoreParker, Phillips, and two or tares more belong.Even poor Dr. Bellows or our city, who was thoughtliberal enough to be let off easily by the Bostoncritics, was handled without mercy. Of DanielWebster, he said: liberal 'If any noble soul in the State will stir ourmother Massachusetts to behead his image, we willsacredly cherish the name of that true Massachusettsboy. And a Boston audience cheered the sentiment withloud and prolonged applause. We know not whichmost to pity, the man who can thus insult thememory of the noblest statesmen New England hasproduced, or an audience that would cheer him inhis infamous discourse.â€”New York Oberserver.
