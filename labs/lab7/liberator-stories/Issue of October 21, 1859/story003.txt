 During the repetition of Mr. Everett's eulogy onDaniel Webster at Boston, petitions for the removalof the Webster statue were circulated among the audienceand, it is said, were numerously signed. Itis scarcely probable that such a mean mark of disrespectto the favorite orator of Massachusetts, andsuch an untimely and indecent insult to the memoryof Daniel Webster, can meet the approval of anyreputable portion of the citizens of Boston. It isonly another illustration of the vulgarity and virulenceof the 'Down-East' abolitionists. Simultaneously with this exhibition of bad tasteon the part of the Bostonians towards their greatestliving orator and their greatest dead or living statesman,comes a proposition to erect a statue to thelate Horace Mann on the State House grounds, immediatelyopposite to that of Webster. It is possiblethat Mann, like many other New-Englanders ofextreme theories and ill-rounded judgments, deservesa statue, although his reputation is not very greatout of his own State; but be differed as far fromMr. Webster in mental dimensions as in principles,and in the comprehension of the constitutional dutiesand powers of the Federal Government. Moreover,he was a life-long opponent and enemy ofWebster, an a small scale; and this new proposition,coming from the source and in the manner andtime it does, is evidently only another exhibition ofpique against the latter, which the Legislature, intheir devotion to the extreme anti-slavery party, willprobably indulge. There is only one further tributewhich the modern Athens ban pay to modern Art,worthy of the development in that quarter of modernideas, and that is, the erection on she same spot of anebony statue of a strapping negro. Altar havingplaced Webster in such company, it is probable thateven the Abolitionists would be contended.â€”N.Y.Journal of Commerce. N.Y.Journal of Commerce.
