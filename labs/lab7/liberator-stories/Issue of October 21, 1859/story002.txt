 Between from Gen. Benjamin F. Butler's letter, accepting hisnomination as candidate for Governor of Massachusetts:— Upon the question of slavery, which appears tocontrol the political action of a majority in Massachusettsin preference to objects affecting their moreimmediate interests, I believe I can be equally explicit,having no opinions to conceal. In my opinion,slavery exists nowhere by natural right, butonly because of some positive enactment embodiedeither in the constitution or statute law of the communityin which it is found. Again, I believe it to be the essential element ofthe democratic creed,—as promulgated at Cincinnati,in 1856, as well as plainly deducible from thedoctrines of the 'Fathers of the Republic,' one towhich every living democratic statesman has, atsame period, pledged himself,—that the people ofevery community, who amociate themselves upon theTerritory of the United States, and obtain aufficientsumbers to be organized into a Territorial Government,have the right, by their legislation, under theConstitution, to manage all their domestic institutionsin their own way—or in other words, to determinefor themselves the status of society under whichthey will live, and that this right continues untilthe formation of such territory into a state, when itis conceded by all. Then, slaves being decided to beproperty by the Supreme Court, in the states whereclavery exists by local as in the several states, givingthe master the right to hold them while there is noterritorial legislation on the subject, with the furtherright to remove them within a reasonable timeafter legislation is had, that divests him of hisproperty by a law declaring them free. This wouldput the rights of the South upon their true constitutionalbasis, leaving the public domain fairly opento competition and emigration; permitting thequestion of 'bond or free' to be settled by the naturallaws of interest and profit, or by the newly-firmedcommunity, as son as it is of ability to settleany other question of governmental policy:retaining in the slaveholder, who had brought hisproperty upon the public land, under the protectionof the Constitution, the right to take it away, if indanger of being divested of it by territorial legislation.More than this the South ought not to ask;more than this the North ought not to grant. Ofcause, from the reasoning, no one would hold thatby carrying his slaves into unoccupied and unorganizedterritory, the master waives his right to himto that by this act he would be emancipated Uponthis subject, I deem the public mind to be substantiallysettled in the full determination to lave slaveryto be dealt with by the laws of the severallocalities where it has its existence. With it, we inMassachusetts have nothing to do, save to let italone, or to treat it in our political, as we do in ourbusiness relations, wherein we buy and sell the productsof slave labor, and furnish our own fabrics forits support, thus recognizing the institution as anexisting fact, for which we are in no way responsible,salves, save to sell our brogans and negro cloths, forthe use of the slave, as dearly as possible, and tobuy its cotton and sugars as cheaply as we can.These opinions upon the subject of the rights of themaster to his slaves in the territories are in view ofthe action Congress ought to take in the matter, andare wholly independent of the judicial aspects ofthose questions which will be doubtless settled accordingto their legal merits, when they arise in thevarious matters of controversy. After deliberatereduction upon these topics, I see nothing to alter,and therefore prefer again to use the identical words.Our nameless opponents, not subscribing to theseprinciples, but claiming 'irrepressible conflict' betweenthe Northern and Southern systems of labor,and insisting upon Congressional interference againstthe local institutions of a part of the country, aremost directly sapping the foundations of the Unionby an utter disregard of the Constitution. Whilethey confined themselves to resolutions and speeches,harmless enough except from the irritation and badblood which they might engender between the differentsections of the country, there was not much tostartle or alarm the patriot. That they mean tosorry them into action is seen from the fact that eversince the Convention of which we are now writing,by a strict party vote, in the Massachusetts Houseof Representatives, they have attempted to organizethe military force of the State in opposition to themilitia of the United States, the laws, and the Constitution.Passing over the palpable, deliberate insultto the volunteer militia of Massachusetts, inassociating the Indian and negro with them, on anequality, in an organization largely partaking of asocial character, they further propose, by compulsoryenactment, to require the negro and Indian tobe enrolled and drafted to serve side by side with thewhite man! That this cannot be done under theConstitution of the United States is obvious. Thatthe service is repugnant to the feelings and sentimentsof the people of this Commonwealth is clearlyshown, because in the analogous organization of thefire companies, no negro has ever been enlisted, althoughthere is no restraining enactment. Why,then, compel the soldier by law to serve with ablack man, when the fireman will not do so voluntarily?That this was knowingly attempted by theLegislature in violation of the Constitution of theUnited States is true, form the fact that their favoriteleader, who has christened that party with theonly name it has ever borne—his own—declared inthe Constitutional Convention of 1853 as Follows:— status 'New, in my opinion it is impossible for us se toprovide in the Constitution of Massachusetts, that everyside-bodied citizen, irrespective of color, shall be admittedinto the militia of the State, as is desired bythese petitioners, for it would be in direct contraventionof the Constitution of the Untied States.' irrespective of color At the time of the utterance of this doctrine, hewas under salutary influences; what has been theoffest of his preset unhappy party associations,upon his opinions upon constitutional law, remainsto be soon. 'The present administration of theState Government 'has therefore two wings; one ofwhich believes that the intelligent naturalized citizen,whether English, German, Irish, Polo or Hungarian,is not fit to bear arms in the militia; andthe other that the full-blooded negro is eminentlyit. You may think, gentlemen, that I have givena very considerable prominence to this unconstitutionalsot of disunion; but I look upon it as the'baby figure of the giant mass of things to come atlast. Not satisfied with this so unjust discriminationin favor of the negro, and against the naturalizedcitizen, yielding to the fear of the rattle of thedead bones of Know-Nothingism, they have forcedthrough a amendment of our State Constitutionwhich deprives the citizen of that most substantialof all the rights for which our fathers contended,the right to vote In the choice of his rulers for twoyears after he had become a citizen of the UntiedStates, and entitled to all other privileges of the nativeborn. Let us labor together, therefore, pledgingthe democratic party to an 'irrepressible conflict,'until this disgraceful injustice and wrong istrishaw from our frame of government!
