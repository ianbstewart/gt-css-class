 The Hon. Charles F. Adams having notified theHon. Horace Mann of his nomination, by the membersof the Free Soil party in the Eighth CongressionalDistrict, as their candidate for Congress, Mr. Maudevotes a very large portion of his reply to a scathingreview of the Fugitive Slave Bill—as follows:— In regard to this Fugitive Slave Bill, is it not astonishingthat men should ever ask the question:Does the Constitution demand the trial by jury, insteadof the question: Will the Constitution allowit? The first is the tyrant's question, granting nomore than he is compelled to give. The last is therepublican's question, volunteering all that he cangrant. In a free government, where the trial byjury is held to be the surest safeguard of personalliberty, the inquiry ought never to be, whether theConstitution secures or necessitates this form of trial;for it is enough, if the Constitution will permit or tolerateit. Instead of seeking evasions, and closeconstructions, and hunting among the musty precedentsof darker times, in order to shut out the jurytrial in cases of personal liberty, the true loves offreedom would ask only for an interpretation thatwould warrant it. It would not be among his lastthoughts; he would not wait until a stern necessityforced such a construction upon him; but his firstdesire and effort would be to find some legitimatereason for conferring it. He would not ask in howfew cases he must, but in how many be might, admitit. Yet this matter has been discussed, and isstill discussed, on one side, as though we were boundto avoid the jury trial, if we could; not as thoughwe were bound to grant it, if by fair interpretationwe might It has been discussed as if the jury trial,to protect a man's right to himself, were an evil;and as though the sudden seizure, 'summary' adjudicationand speedy consignment of a fellow-being tobondage, were too precious a blessing to be putin jeopardy by submission to twelve good and lawfulmen. Not how much may we do for freedom,but how much can we do for slavery, has been thetacit assumption of the argument But I pass bythis for graver objections demand allow secures or necessitates permit or tolerate warrant The Fugitive Slave Bill purports to confer judicialpower upon persons who are not judges Itprovides for the creation of scores and hundreds ofofficers called 'commissioners', and upon these, it issaid on high authority, to confer original and finaljurisdiction on questions of human liberty TheConstitution declares in whom 'the judicial power ofthe United States shall be vested'. It shall be vested'in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courtsas Congress may from time to time establish' Nocommissioner, nor any number of commissioners,constitutes one of these courts 'The judges, bothof the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold theiroffices during good behavior' A commissioner canbe made and unmade, on any day These judgesare to 'receive for their services a compensation,which shall not be diminished during their continuancein office'. The commissioners are compensatedby chance fees, and not by a fixed salary ThePresident nominates and the Senate confirms judgesof the supreme and inferior courts Commissionersare only the 'inferior officers', who may be appointed by 'the courts of law'. original final I need not enforce the position, that the powerwhich this Bill purports to confer upon commissionersis judicial It has all the attributes of judicial power.It is original, finaland exclusive.They are 'tohear and determine' The fourth section says they'shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the judges ofthe circuit and district courts of the United States'.The Attorney General of the United States, in awritten opinion, given by command of the Presidentof the United States, says as follows—'These officersand each of them [the commissioners]havejudicial power, and jurisdiction to hear, examine anddecide the case'.—The certificate to be granted tothe owner is to be regarded as the act and judgmentof a judicial tribunal having competent jurisdiction'.'Congress has constituted a tribunal with exclusivejurisdiction to determine summarily, and without appeal,who are fugitives from service'—'the judgmentof the tribunal created by this act in conclusive uponall tribunals.' The power of a commissioner, therefore,is judicialin the highest sense,—in the sense ofthe Constitution His decision cannot be re-heardor re-examined by any judge, or by any court, of anyState, or of the United States In no other case acommissioner perform any judicial act, or issueany executive order, whose validity may not be re-examinedin the court for which he acts, or in someother. He cannot strike a blow, nor-from a dollar, norpunish by imprisonment for an hour. By appeal, byinjunction, by mandamus or certiorari, the proceedingsof inferior courts or magistrates can be reached,and their legality or constitutionality tested. Buthere a multitude of tribunals are established overwhose proceedings, not the Supreme Court of anyState; no, not even the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates, has supervision. And what do these commissionersdecide? That a man has no right to himself;that his body, limbs, faculties, are the propertyof another; that he owes service. Suppose the questionwere whether the respondent owed the claimant adollar. Could the commissioner give judgment andissue execution for it? Certainly not. But yet he ishere authorized to decide questions infinitely moreimportant than any amount of money. He is to decidethat a man owes life-long servicefrom himself,and from all the children of his lairs. judicial original, final exclusive. determine' concurrent judicial judicial judicial property owes service. service But the surrender of an alleged fugitive from servicehas been compared with the surrender of a fugitivefrom justice; and became the Supreme Executiveof a State of required by the law of 1783 to surrenderfugitives from justice, it is claimed that anycommissioner may surrender fugitives from service,without liability to question or re-examination by anyhuman authority. But there is a world-wide differencebetween the cause. When the fugitive fromjustice is delivered up, he is delivered into the custodyof the law. Legal process must have been commencedagainst him in the State from which he fled.He is returned, that the proceedings thus commencedmay be consummated. He is never entrusted to privatehands. The shield of the law is continued overhim. After arrest, he is merely transferred from thehands of the law in one State, to the handsof the law in another State. He is transferred, notto evade trail, but to have one. But the allegedslave in delivered us, not into the custody of the law,where his rights might be adjudicated upon, but intoprivate hands; not into the hands of a neutral or indifferentperson, but into the hands of a pasty interestedto deprive him of all his rights;—if he be nota strive, than into the hands of a man-kneeler.

Not only the  be  the characterof the litigants would be changed—plaintiff for defendant,and defendant, for plaintiff. The old caseis not reboard, but a new one tried. Indeed, a veryintelligent writer on this subject has queried whetherthe certificate of the Commissioner may not be pleadedas on estoppal. I say, then, that, in effect, theCommissioner, by this act, has original, final, andexclusive jurisdiction of a 'case' 'in Jaw,' 'arisingunder the Constitution and laws of the United States.'This is the very function of judges and courts. Thisis the identical power which the Constitution of theU.S. vests in judges who are to be nominated bythe President, confirmed by the Senate, to hold officeduring good behavior, and to be compensated by fixed salaries.            original, final exclusive Again, the bill consigns a man to bondage, withoutcrime, on evidence which he has had no opportunityto controvert The claimant must prove threefacts before the Commissioner,—1st, that the personnamed in the warrant owes the claimant service;2d, That he has escaped; 3d, Identity. Now, according to the bill, the first two points,—the facts of owing service and of escaping,—maybe proved behind the respondent's back. This proofmay be procured against the alleged fugitive withoutany notice to him, actual or constructive; withoutthe possibility of his encountering it, or disprovingit, however false it may be. If this be not deprivinga person of his 'liberty,' 'without due processof law,' what can be? Why not make thewhole case provable behind the man's back—inanother State—a thousand miles off—and spurn theforms of justice, after having spurned its substance?This binding of a man by evidence obtained withouthis knowledge, is unknown to the common law, andabhorrent to it. It is never permitted, not even todeprive the worst man of the humblest right. Ourlaws save the rights of all parties under disability.Who is under so great a disability as he who knowsnothing, and can know nothing, of what is going onagainst him? Notwithstanding. the Constitution declaresthat full faith and credit shall be given in eachState to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedingsof every other State,' yet it has been held that ajudgment obtained in another State, withoutnotice, shall not prejudice the party against whom itwas rendered. Such an act violates the first principlesof justice. All securities for the life, libertyand property of us all are swept away, if such principlescan be established. Once more: The bill says the certificate 'shall beconclusive of the right of the person or persons inwhose favor granted, to remove such fugitive to theState or territory from which he escaped, and shallprevent all molestation of such person or persons, byany process issued by any court, judge, magistrate,or any other person whomsoever.' According tothis, the certificate is a talisman which protects itsholder against all law, all evidence, and all judicialpower. A kidnapper may seize a free man in Boston,buy evidence that he owes this mysterious debtof service, obtain the requisite certificate against hisvictim and then neither the mother who bore him,nor the elder brothers and sisters who grew upwith him, nor the neighbors who have known him,from his cradle, nor the minister who baptized him,can testify that he is free; nor can all the judgesand courts in the Commonwealth stop the man whois bearing away one of their fellow-citizens to a bondageworse than death, to inquire into his title. Heis in a charmed circle, that neither justice nor lawcan enter. Do you ask where is that old time-honoredwrit of Habeas Corpus, for which martyrs havedied and rivers of blood have flowed, and which theConstitution declares SHALL NOT be suspended, 'unlesswhen in cases of rebellion or invasion, the publicsafety may require it? The answer it, 'process issued'by a court, and the bill declares that the holderof the certificate shall be exempt from all 'molestation,''by any process issued by any court.' In oneword, the law contains a provision that its own constitutionalityshall not be brought into question; atleast, until its victim reaches the place of his bondage,and is beyond the reach of rescuing hands. HALL NOT Now, even if this bill does not commit suchgross infractions of the Constitution that the courtswill set it aside, yet it would seem as though nosane man could help seeing that it wars upon allour ideas of justice; that it repudiates and scornsall the great securities, for freedom which wise andgood men for centuries past have given their laborsand their lives to establish; and that it convertsthe vast machinery of the social slate, not intothe means of protecting, but of assailing, the libertiesof the citizen. As to the appointment of commissioners,it gives us none of the constitutional securitiesthat improper men will not be invested withthese high prerogatives against our dearest rights;and as to the manner in which evidence may beprocured, it resembles the missives which the Inquisitionin olden times sent forth against heresies, toseize without law to try without defence, and topunish without mercy or hope. It resembles theLetters de coche! which, before the great revolution,the despots of France gave, in blank to villain courtiers,and villain courtesans, to be filled up with thenames of those persons whose perdition they wouldcompass. Letters de coche! in blank There are other points in this bill, whose enormityonly needs to be stated to be seen and abhorred.One of them is so unspeakably mean and contemptible,that all Northern men must feel the insult morekeenly than the wrong. It provider that if a Commissionerwill doom a man to bondage, his fee shallbe twice as much as though he restored him to liberty.Now, every body known that claimants will rarely,if ever, appear before commissioners without apris f case. If there be no defence, the proceedingswill be brief. But a case of discharge pre-supposesa defence and a trial. A case of discharge,therefore, will probably occupy as much time as half a dozen cases of surrender. Yet for thisgreater labor; the commissioner is to have but halfprice. In assailing all we love of liberty, could notthe framers and supporters of this measure have forborneto wound us in all we feel of honor? pris f   The cases are to be 'heard and determined,' asthey were under Robespierre, 'in a summary manner.'Shakespeare enumerates the 'law's delay'among the causes of suicide. Under this bill, realsuicides will doubtless be occasioned by the law'sdispatch. This summary manner' contains the sumof wrong. Does not every lawyer and every clientknow that when an action is brought for the unfaithfulexecution of a contract in building a house or achip, or for the balance of an account, or for flowinglands; or for defamation or libel, the defendant needsweeks and often months, to make ready for his defence?His witnesses may be in another State, orabroad; it may be necessary to examine ancient titlesin registries of deeds or of wille, to make purveysof premises, or investigations into character andconduct. It often happens that when process isfirst served upon a man, he does not know thegrounds of his own defence. They may consist offacts which he has forgotten or of law of which heis ignorant. Our courts, acting upon this well-knowntruth, have established a rule that a party, even afterhe has had fourteen days notice, shall be entitledto a continuance as a matter of right, unless underspecial circumstances; and he may always haveit on cause shown. I ask any defendant who wasever forced into court to resist a claim of any magnitudeor difficulty, whether he was ready to do soon the instant when process was served against him.Yet this is what the respondent must do under theFugitive Slave Bill. On the 26th day of last September,James Hamlet was peacefully pursuing a lawfuloccupation in Water street, New York, and earningan honest support for his wife and children. Inthree hours, handcuffed, in irons, and surrounded byarmed men, he was on his way to the House ofBondage. No time was given him for procuringthe aid of counsel. He declared he was free, thathis another was a free woman and he a free man. But,by another provision in the bill, it is declared thatin no trial or hearing under this act, shall the testimonyof such alleged fugitive be admitted in evidence.'In all other cases, within the broad compassof the common or statue law of Great Britain or ofthis country, a party litigant may give evidence persuadingto the suit. In some cases, he may giveevidence on the merits; in all cases, be may makeaffidavit on interlecutionary matters. A man whohas been in the State prison, a felon, scarred withcrime, may still make an affidavit, in his own case,under certain circumstances, though he can testifyneither for nor against any other person. But an allegedfugitive can make oath to no fact, and underno circumstances, for delay or other cause. It wouldconflict with that 'summary manner' in which it isdeemed expedient dispose of human liberty. in a summary manner.' law'sdispatch. Look at this provision under the light of a few facts.In the case of Mahoney v. Ashton; [4 Harris &Mc-Henry'sMaryland Reports,) the petitioner for freedomclaimed that a material ancestor, four generations, backwho had been brought over by Lord Baltimore,in the early days of the colony, was free;and, by an extraordinary chain of evidence, he tracedhis descent from that free source. It was a claimwhich any court in Massachusetts would have sustainedwithout hesitation. four generations, back Now, how much evidence of history, of record, ofparol; does the bare mention of such a case suggest?Who could have been prepared to try it in threehours; by, as soon as he could be seized and hurriedto a lawyer's office? Among the alleged fugitives in the 'Pearl cases,'so called, which I assisted in trying in Washington,in the years 1848 and '49, was the family of DanielBell, consisting of his wife and (I think) seven children.The mother and children had been freed manyyears before by deed of manumission, executed bytheir master in his last sickness, and they had beenreputed free over afterwards. Soon after the granter'sdeath, the device was started of proving him tobe of 'unsound mind,' and thus reclaiming the familyto bondage. But the magistrate who preparedthe deed, witnessed its execution, and took the acknowledgment,declared that he stood ready in testifyto the competency of the granter, and the validityof the instrument. Years passed away, and hedied. Immediately, the heirs claimed the family asslaves; and, after the loss of the deceased magistrate'stestimony, proved the granter of 'unsoundmind,' and so set aside the deed, and were adjudgedowners of the chaltela. On the ground of newly discoveredevidence, application for a new trial wasmade; but the family becoming alarmed lest theyshould be secretly seized and sent to the South, attemptedto escape on board the 'Pearl,' on the nightof the 13th of April. Now, suppose that they hadsucceeded, and that, after arriving in a free State,they had been seized and carried before a commissioner,to be tried in this 'summary manner,' withouteven waiting for a crier to open court, and debarredfrom making affidavit that, in the city of Washington,there existed evidence of their freedom. I willnot waste words to point out the impossibility oftheir defence, and the certainly of their doom! Hethat hath ears to hear the cry of the oppressed, lethim hear! competency chaltela. A few days before the close of the last session ofCongress, I was inquired of by a resident in Washington,as to the condition of a family held us slavesin that city. I found they were free by the laws ofthe District, but they did not know it. Sir, throughout the Southern States, there are thousandsand thousands of reputed slaves, who, legally,and by the laws of those States, too, in which theyare held, are as free as the Governor of Massachusetts,or the Chief Justice; but, in their enforced andbrutish ignorance, the victims do not know it; andshould they come to a tree State, and there be hunted,and seized, and carried before a Commissioner,they would be debarred from taking an oath as tofacts which would furnish grounds for a continuance,so that their right to freedom might be established.But, under such obstructions and embarrassments,liberty could not be extinguished in a sufficiently'summary manner.' According to the Constitution of the UnitedStates, all criminals from the least to the greatest,are to be informed of the nature and cause of theiraccusation; to be confronted with the witnessesagainst them; to have compulsory process for obtainingwitnesses in their favor; and to have the assistanceof counsel in their defence. Yet here, alwaysin the case of a free man, there is to be no previousnotice, no process for obtaining witnesses, and no provisionfor counsel; and while the court is forbiddento allow delay, without good cause shown, the partywhose liberty is at stake cannot make out thatcause by his oath; but with the full knowledge inhis own breast that he is free, he must stand dumbbefore the minister of the law that puts on his fetters. criminals I will not dwell at any length upon those portionsof the bill which affect marshals and deputy marshals.If any man chooses not to hold office undersuch a law, he can decline to accept it, or resign it.It is, however, clear proof of wicked legislation,when humane and conscientious men cannot holdthe offices it creates. But the 5th section containsa provision which is atrocious. It makes the marshalor his deputy liable for an escape, whether made'with or without his assent,'—that is, at all events.Though the alleged fugitive should disable him,though the enemies of the country should capturehim, though the act of God should strike him down,though an armed mob should commit a rescue,—yethe still liable. without at all events. All civilized governments have statutes of limitations.Human welfare requires that claims thathave long been voluntarily acquiesced in should notbe revived. Hence our laws bar a right of action,otherwise incontrovertible, after that tacit abandonmentof which the mere lapse of time is proof. Personalrights are most generally abandoned by a sixyears' neglect to enforce them. Even real estatemay be field, by twenty years' quiet possession, withoutother title. Crimes partake of this exemption.With the single exception of murder, all crimes arebarred in Massachusetts by a six years' delay toprosecute. But the Fugitive Slave Bill knows nomercy or compassion of this kind. Unrelentingly,it fastens its clutch upon all cases. While life lasts,its fangs strike into the flesh. The alleged slavemay have been amongst us for fifty years, he mayhave earned property, be married, and surroundedby children. It is all the game. The inexorablecertificate of a Commissioner remands him to bondageand despair. The Bill not only remands him to bondage, but,under circumstances to which there will be few exceptions,it orders that he be sent home at the publicexpense. The Constitution says, he shall be 'deliveredup.' There the obligation of that instrumentceases. It is only the law that adds, and he shall becarried back. You and I, sir, must help pay the costof sending a fellow-being into bondage: when weare under no more constitutional obligation to doso, than to pay the expenses of a slave dealer whoships his cargoes direct from Africa. carried back. But the bill has become a law, and the practicalquestion now is, how can the country be exculpatedfrom the crime and the dishonor? For myself, I donot adopt the doctrine of forcible nullification. I trustI shall never join a mob to resist a law until I amready for revolution. The only true and enduringremedy is Repeal. Those who would forcibly resist thelaw, lose half their motive and interest for repeal;for if we abolish it without repealing it, it will belikely to remain upon the statue-book, an eternalmonument of the nation's disgrace. Let effort nevercease, until the jury trial be obtained. But this view of civil duty applies only to thecitizen. It does not touch the fugitive One libertythe slave always has,—whenever he deems it expedient,he may re-clothe himself in the rights whichGod and nature gave him, and which, though theymay be ravished from him, can never be destroyed. citizen. Until repeal, however, there is one opening forhope. If, as is said by Mr. Crittenden, in the opinionalready cited, 'Congress has constituted atribunal with exclusive jurisdiction, to determinesummarily, and without appeal; and if, as he furthersays, 'the judgment of every tribunal of exclusivejurisdiction, where no appeal lies, is of necessity conclusiveupon every other tribunal AND THEREFORETHE JUDGMENT OF THE TRIBUNAL CREATED BY THISACT IS CONCLUSIVT. UPON ALL TRIBUNALS;' then thewhole case, in all  bearings and relations, its sourcesand its issues, comes before the commissioner;not even the Supreme Court of the United States caninterfere with him; and the first question for him to'hear and determine' it, whether in truth there beany such law, whether the whole disgraceful enactmentbe not unconstitutional and void; and therefore,whether his first and only duty be not to dismissthe proceedings and 'let the captive go free.'I am not without hope that such will be the result,and that many conscientious and law-abiding menwill be relieved from the anxiety and the mental conflictwhich now oppresses their minds. exclusive conclusiveupon every other tribunal  law Very truly, your obedient servant, HORACE MANN.
