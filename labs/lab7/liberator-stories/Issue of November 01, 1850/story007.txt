 A SILVEN FLAGON TO THE HATNAU MOB. We seeis stated on good authority, that a superb silver flagonis to be presented by the mechanics and brewers ofthis city to the workmen of Messrs. Barely andPerkins' Brewery in London, in commemoration, asour authority says, 'for their conduct in chastisingthe butcher Haynau.' The flagon is to be of largesize, embossed with a view of the chastisement on oneside, and with a suitable inscription on the other.—N.Y. Express. ILVEN LAGON TO THE ATNAU OB. N.Y. Express. Haynau was the mere tool and instrument of thedespotic government of Austria. So is the N.Y.Express a base and groveling tool of the SlavePower of this country—a power infinitely more despoticand abominable than that of Austria. Wehave nothing to say in favor of the 'butcher Haynau';but it he deserved mobbing for his treatmentof the friends of Hungary; what do the soullessknaves of the Express deserve, for their treatmentof the friends of the slave, during the last dozenyears?—Mohawk Times. Mohawk Times.
