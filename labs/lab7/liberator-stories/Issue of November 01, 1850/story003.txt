 Debate in the U.S. Senate on the Amendment of Mr.Seward to the Slave Trade Bill, providing for theAbolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia. [concluded.] Mr. EWINO. I do not, myself, Mr. President, givemuch weight in legislation to ordinary letters,whether they be anonymous, or vouched for by respectablenames. they amount, in general, to littlemore than a mere statement of the information oropinion of the individual, very frequently foundedupon no facts whatever, or upon few facts, with muchinference. I should have given very little weight,beyond the single case stated as occurring withinthe actual knowledge of the writer, to the letter introducedby the Senator from Massachusetts, if ithad called forth no comments and no contradiction.But, at the same time, I do not think a Senator liableto any just reproach or harsh animadversions, forintroducing a letter into the Senate, especially if hetakes care to say that he does not vouch for the truthof its statements: Indeed, the Senator from Massachusettshad a worthy precedent near at band fordealing in this kind of evidence. Why, sir, it isbut a very few days, perhaps I should rather sayweeks, since, in debate here, the Senator from Georgia(Mr. Berrien) introduced and read in the Senate,a letter from California, written by a respectablegentleman to another respectable gentleman, thenames of neither of whom that honorable Senatorsaw fit to give; on the authority of which letter, thehonorable Senator thought paper to insist, in a verydirect and emphatic manner, that the military officersand diplomatic agents of the Government had deludedthe people of California into the adoption ofthe anti-slavery proviso in their Constitution. Thehonorable Senator from Georgia did not vouch forthat statement at all. He argued from it, he reasonedfrom it, as though he believed the statement,he still dwelt upon it with no diminished emphasis:and his speech, which has since been published,shows that he felt himself authorized to treat it asa fact proved. I took care then to advise the honorableSenator that the statement was without foundation,and I now say, as I then said, though inmore emphatic terms, that every word of it, whichcharges such interference on that question, is false.Yet I imputed then, and now impute nothing to theSenator from Georgia unworthy of his character andstation; not at all. But, certainly, he stood in nomore favorable situation than does the Senator fromMassachusetts, whom he animadverts upon with somuch severity now, for having introduced a letter,the name of the writer of which he gave us,and for whose statements he declared he did notvouch. WINO. Mr. BERRIEN. This is a personal assault, whichrequires a word from me. ERRIEN. Mr. EWING. It is no assault at all, but a merenarrative of what occurred here but a few weeks ago. WING. Mr. BERRIEN. It is the lamest and most impotentattempt at an analogy that ever was presentedto the consideration of a body of intelligent men.I introduced a letter. I was not called upon for thename of the water. I said it was a letter addressedby a respectable citizen of Baltimore, formerly, to amember of this Senate, who would vouch for hisrespectability. Now, sir, is there any analogy betweenthese two cases? I did believe, upon the testimonywhich I had received, that that letter was entitledto credit; and I argued from it as so entitled.But with respect to the statement which the Senatorfrom Ohio contests, it is a statement of a fact whichcould not have been within the knowledge of theSenator from Ohio, but of which the writer of thatletter might have had personal knowledge. Consequently,notwithstanding the contradiction of theSenator from Ohio, that letter remains as evidence,with the credit of a letter vouched for in the manner.I have stated. I take the responsibility of avowingmy belief in the truths stated in that letter. I did soat the time; I do so now. I did it upon the authorityto which I have referred, and which I stated tothe Senate. Whenever any Senator shall present aletter or other paper, giving reference to the authorityupon which he relies for giving credence to it,then he will be in the condition in which I waswhen I presented the letter to which the Senatorfrom Ohio alludes, not in that of the Senator fromMassachusetts. ERRIEN. Mr. EWING. One word more with respect to thatletter. If my memory  me, it stood preciselyin the same situation in which the honorable Senatorplaces the memorial of the ship-owners and ship-mastersof Boston, which the honorable Senator saysis no evidence whatsoever, because they had no personalknowledge of what they stated. The writerof that letter, if I am not mistaken, and if I am, theSenator can current me, was not in California at thetime the Constitution was formed. I may be incorrectas to that fact, but my impression is, that hewas not, and that he does not say that he from personal knowledge. Besides, sir, the onlyperson representing the government in California, asis well known, and is known to the Senator fromGeorgia, was a distinguished gentleman from hishis own State,(Mr. T. Butler King,) who has denied,in most express terms, in a card published byhimself, that he had ever said one single word uponthe subject of the restriction of slavery to a humanbeing in California. That denial was published beforethe Senator read the letter to the Senate. WING.   Mr. BERRIEN. That denial was published, I presume.I have not seen it. I take it on the statementof the Senator from Ohio. But the statementto which I referred was in the debates in the Conventionof California, and mode by a member of thatbody. ERRIEN. Mr. EWINE. No such statement was made there. WINE. Mr. BERRIEN. Not about a convention withthat gentleman? ERRIEN. Mr. EWING. Not at all, with respect to the matterin question. WING. Mr. BERRIEN. Was there no conversation withthat agent, in which he requested that they wouldinclude the whole, in order to remove difficulty inthe way of legislation on this subject? ERRIEN. Mr. EWING. Oh! certainly. WING. Mr. BERRIEN. Which unquestionably had referenceto that. ERRIEN. Mr. EWING. That is not the subject in controversybetween us. I said not a word about theboundaries of California. WING. Mr. BUTLER. I certainly have no angry feelingabout this controversy; but the Senate will bear mewitness, that this is the fifth: time that this law ofSouth Carolina has been introduced by the Senatorsfrom Massachusetts, with a view to pronounce theircensure and condemnation of it, upon the groundthat it is inhuman, and that it is treating this blackrace in a way not contemplated by the Constitution,and repugnant to the feelings of the extremely sentimentalpeople. [Laughter.] Now, Sir, I did not introducethe subject, but I rise to say, on this occasion,that if Massachusetts, or all the other States Northof the Potomac, suppose that by any legislation herethey can compel, or under duress law induce SouthCarolina to give up this police right of regulatingthis class of persons, they are vastly mistaken; forSouth Carolina will never give it up. Moreover,sir, I do not think that those complaints of the wayin which these beings are regarded comes with avery good grace from Massachusetts. Why, howdoes one of their Reverend, grave writers, Dr.Belcamp say that the negro children are regardedthere? [Laughter.] He says— UTLER. 'Negro children were reckoned as an incumbrancein a family; and when weaned, were given away likepuppies. [Laughter.] They have been publicly advertisedin the newspapers, "to be given away."'[Renewed laughter.] Mr. WINTHROP. How many years ago was that? INTHROP. Mr. BUTLER. It was in 1780, I believe. UTLER. Mr. WINTEROROh! INTEROR Mr. BUTLER. I will say to the Senator fromMassachusetts, that I have a very great respect forhis ancestors. Yet, though I have a great respectfor that Senator himself also, I do not believe thathe is any wiser or better than his ancestor who landedon Plymouth rock.[Laughter.] UTLER. Mr. WINTHROP. I wish I was half as good. Butthe Senator is slightly mistaken as to dates. My ancestordid not land at Plymouth rock at all; he cameover, ten years afterwards, to Salem. INTHROP. Mr. BUTLER. Well, I was only showing you howyour ancestors regarded these creatures. With regardto the witness whom the Senator from Massachusettshas produced here—this man Ranlett—Ihad a conversation with a gentleman coming fromthe navy yard this morning, and he said he had nodoubt if there was any truth in the story, this manRanlett went into Charleston with the negroes forsalvage, and finding if he took the negroes out hewould have to divide it, he left them there, and tookit all to himself. [Laughter.] UTLER. Mr. WINTHROP. And I have conversed to-daywith two gentlemen, who say that they know CaptainRanlett, and they testify that he is a captain of highrespectability and intelligence. One of them saysthat he now owns his own ship, and is just about tosail on a voyage on his own behalf. I only hope hewill not have gone before he has an opportunity ofexplaining this matter for himself. INTHROP. Mr. DAVIS, of Massachusetts, I will detain theSenate but a few moments with what I have to say.I regret that the debate which has sprung up, collaterally,with the subject of this bill, has, in some partsof it, at least, been characterized with unnecessaryharshness towards my colleague. I must say that Ido not think it an unreasonable proposition, on thepart of Massachusetts, to ask for the judicial decisionof a question of constitutional right. I think,on the contrary, it is what cannot, in any just exerciseof power, be denied. This right is not derived,as some Senators seem to suppose, from any thingcontained in any State Constitution. It is secured,if secured at all to the party, by the Constitution ofthe United States, and by that instrument alone. Ifit has no foundation there, it has none anywhere.And it is the trial of that right, by the tribunal prescribedby law, which the State of Massachusettshas sought, and nothing more. It follows, as a matterof course, that that right is in no way dependentupon State Constitutions. It is in no way dependentupon the emigration laws of Louisiana, which havebeen referred to. It is in no way dependent uponany police regulations which may exist anywhere.But these police laws, if they interfere with theConstitution of the United States, and deprive usof any right therein secured, are unlawful. Thisis the point to be settled, and it is surprising thatthere should be any opposition to it. AVIS Sir, I have heard with some astonishment thequestion of fact in this matter brought into doubt.here. There can be no question whatever about it.The State of Massachusetts did not proceed in thismatter without evidence before her to satisfy her allthe point. She had, without doubt, evidence whichsatisfied her legislature, and the other branches ofher government, that complaints of this descriptionwere well founded, and she took measures accordingly.Well, Sir, she sent an agent to Charleston.The people of Carolina are an honorable and high-mindedpeople, and what did they do? Every oneknows that they did not question the facts. TheSenator from South Carolina himself does not denythem. Our agent laid before the Governor of SouthCarolina the purport of his mission. The Governordid not deny the existence of such a law. He didnot deny or question the alleged. He did notdeny that there was a prison there for the purpose,and that these colored persons were confined in it.But treating the statement as well founded, he laidthe whole subject before the Legislature of the State,alleging that it was an attempt to interfere with thelaws of the State, and the Legislature took steps toprevent the decision of this question by judicial tribunals.Well. Sir, if there had been no foundationfor these complaints, as some gentlemen seem tosuppose, there might have been a very plain answergiven. That agent might have been told, 'You havecome here upon a complaint that has no foundation;you have no real cause for legal or any other controversy,as these things which you allege as a grievancenever take place; you may go into court if youcan find a case to found a complaint upon.' Sir,they took no such course as that, but on the contrary,they opposed obstacles which proved insuperableto legal process. But I need not repeat these facts.The Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Butler) admits,if I understand him, that they are to as extenttrue, though not to so great an extent as some suppose.The same thing is substantially true of Louisiana.The honorable Senator from that State (Mr,Soulu) only argues from laws which he adduces, thatit is impossible that these things should take place.If, however, these practices do exist, his argumentwould prove they are unsupported by law, whichwould only make them the more objectionable. Mr. SOULE. I deny moat positively that they canor do take place. OULE. Mr. DAVIS. I can see that the Senator draws aconclusion, which conclusion is tantamount to a denial;but then he must admit that, under the lawswhich he has read, a person of this description, afterhe has been in the State thirty days, is subject tothis confinement. Now, I will not enter into anycontroversy with the Senator from Louisiana, as Ihave no time to look into the laws of that State, butI will take an opportunity to do it, and I think I canshow that in the cases where these individuals havebeen imprisoned in Louisiana, it has been done undersome law there. At least, I am unwilling to believeotherwise. That it has been done in Louisianaadmits in any opinion, of no doubt. There areample proofs of it, according to my information, andI have no doubt, they can be obtained. Well, sir, thesame thing happened in Louisiana did not say to thegentleman who went from Massachusetts, 'This isan unfounded complaint; it is untrue is itself; Youhave no cause to come here to redress imaginarywrong; your citizens have not been imprisoned.'That would have been a full and complete answer;but no such answer was made. On the contrary, thesubject was communicated to the Legislature fortheir consideration. I do not men to impute anyintentional misstatement or error to the Senator fromLouisiana, but I think it will turn out that there issome law or authority which has been overlooked,or some existing practice or regulation; for that theseamen sailing from the North have been seized andimprisoned at New Orleans admits of no doubt whatever,unless we have all been misled by evidencewhich we felt authorized to credit. However, Mr.President, I will dismiss the subject, for I am anxiousnot to detain the Senate in regard to it, since itwas fully discussed on a former day. AVIS. And now, sir, I wish to add a few words in relationto the amendment proposed by the Senator fromNew York, [Mr. Seward] This amendment is presentedat a moment and under circumstances that Iregret. I am sorry that the Senator from New Yorkthought it to be his duty to ask the attention of theSenate to the subject in this connection. I havenone of the difficulty which exists in the minds ofmany gentlemen here, with regard to the power ofCongress to deal with slavery in this District. Ihave no doubt in my mind that Congress has fullConstitutional power and authority to emancipate theslaves—none whatever. The grant of power is interms too broad, clear and ample to admit of doubt.For one, I should rejoice to see it done; and underother and less objectionable circumstances, I wouldgive my support to a bill for that purpose, providedit gave ample security to all the rights of all the partiesconcerned. I have, on other occasions, givenproofs of the sincerity of the opinion. And whileI say that I should have no difficulty in doingit, candor concepts me to admit that if I considered,as many gentlemen here do, that it could reasonablybe regarded as an aggression upon theirconstitutional rights, or an invasion of these rights,or that it would be an example that must necessarilybe pernicious to them; I should forbear from doingit. But, in my view of the subject, I do not seethat any such consequences as have been suggestedcould result from it; and therefore I should act uponit as if those objections had not been made. But, sir, I do not think that the proposition of theSenator from New York, under the circumstanceswhich exist, commends itself to our support; and Iwill state in a very few words my reasons for notsustaining it. In the first place, the objection whichmy colleague makes to it is sound and unanswerable.He says that it may be the means of defeating thebill for the abolition of the slave trade, which we yethope will take a form acceptable to us. He objects,because it displaces that bill by striking it out, andleaving no provision for the abolition of the slavetrade, and then, if he proposition to emancipate theslaves should prove unacceptable to the people of theDistrict, who are by the terms of the bill to decidewhether they will agree to its provision, the law becomesa nullity, and the slave trade will be left tobe prosecuted as it now is. That, in my opinion, isa very serious objection, as I believe the chances areequal at least that the people will reject the law. Icannot abandon a measure so earnestly desired bythe public as the abolition of the slave trade upon souncertain a contingency of a greater good. But theSenator from New York will pardon me for saying,that the bill itself introduced by him is a crude andill-digested measure, full of imperfections. It doesnot make proper provisions to secure the rights of allparties. It turns, as my colleague justly observed,those persons who are now bound to slavery over tofreedom, without having any means whatever of supportingthemselves. Old and young, sick and well,are, by a dash of the pen, to be turned naked anddestitute into the streets, without the slightest provisionto save them from starvation. There ought tobe some just, suitable and proper provision made uponthat point, to save them at least from crime andsuffering, as there are many persons in this conditionincompetent to provide for themselves so suddenly.In doing a humane act, let us not lose sight of humanity.There ought to be many provisions, in relationto a object so complicated as this is, which I do notfind in this bill, in order to do justice to all the partiesconcerned. The number should first be officiallyascertained, and enough should be known of theircondition and ability to provide for their physicalnecessities to enable us to judge what such anemergency demands of us. We know that a slaveis incapable of holding property, and the momentemancipation takes place, the obligation of the masterto provide for him ceases. While the bill isobviously too defective in this particular to becomea law, it also fails to make any suitable provision forthe indemnity of the masters. It proposes to appropriatetwo hundred thousand dollars, without anyestimate of the value of the slaves, and to leave thewhole matter to the discretion of the Secretary of theInterior, without providing any mode for determiningthe question which must arise. It may well be doubtedwhether such a provision is constitutional, as thereis no provision for a jury to ascertain the damages indisputed cases, nor in fact any provision for bringingany question before the courts; but, whether constitutionalor not, it is too imperfect to stand the testof security. The bill is alike imperfect in other respects;but I shall not enter further into the discussionin order to point them out—those advertedto are fatal. While, therefore, I am in favor of theprinciple, I cannot support this amendment. I believeno one who has advocated the principle is satisfiedwith the proposed amendment. Even the mover isso conscious of a tendency to defeat the slave trademeasure, that he has asked leave to withdraw it, inorder that we may have an opportunity to pass thatbill, if we can out it into an acceptable form. Thisprivilege, I regret to say, has been denied; and aswe must vote upon the amendment under the circumstanceswhich exist, I feel myself compelled tovote against it. It was not my purpose to do morethan to notice some of the leading objections, thatmy vote might not be misunderstood. Mr. DOUGLAS. My own State has been frequentlyreferred to in this debate as containing a provisionin her Constitution similar to the one complained ofin South Carolina, Louisiana, and other States. Illinoishas a provision in her Constitution, making it theduty of the Legislature to provide efficient means forkeeping all negroes from coming into the State, whowere not natives of, or residents in, the State at thetime of the adoption of that instrument. Here, then,is a clear case of legislation of this description in afree State, and I would much rather see this controversygoing on between two free States of theUnion, then to see it made a sectional question betweena slave and a free State. We, too, have aconstitutional provision upon this subject, and beforethat constitutional provision was adopted by an overwhelmingmajority of our people—it having beensubmitted to the people separately, and independentof the balance of the Constitution, so as to get anexpectation of the popular value on the subject—before that provision with adopted, our laws permittedthat if it negro —his to produce a  much to go his authority has goodbehavior, and in the  of his failing scarify, he  for our if at the end of the year he still failed to give it, hewas hired out for another year; and so on until hecould find some white person to go security for hisgood behavior, and that he would not become acharge upon the public. Such has been the legislationof my own State from the time she was first admittedinto the Union, and I presume it has been thesame in other free States. These provisions wererigidly enforced; and now, when I hear that Massachusettscannot get a trial of the constitutionalquestion involved in that legislation, I will assure theSenators from that State that, if they will come toIllinois, we will furnish them all facilities to test theconstitutional question. We are willing to have theright tested, so far as we are concerned. The trial,then, can take place between two free States of theUnion, where there will be no sectional prejudices,no hostile feelings incited, and where we can have afair trial upon the constitutional questions involved.We believed that we have a right to pass all thoselaws that we deem necessary to the quiet and peaceof our own community. These laws are passedamong us as police regulations; they are executedas such. There is no difficulty in having a trialthere, and an appeal to the Supreme Court of theUnited States; and then we can see whether wehave this right or not. We believe that we have theright. We border upon slave States upon two sides.We do not wish to make our State an asylum for allthe old and decrepit and broken down negroes thatmay emigrate or be sent into it. We desire everyother State to take care of her own negroes, whetherfree or slave, and we will take care of ours. Thatlaw was adopted for the purpose of preventing otherStates inundating and colonizing Illinois with freenegroes. We do not believe it to be wise and politicto hold out inducements for that class of peopleto come and live among us. Those who have beenborn in the State, or who were resident there at thetime of the enactment of these laws, are protected inthe enjoyment of all their civil rights; but they arenot placed upon an equality with the whites. Theyare not permitted to serve on juries, or in the militia,or to vote at elections; or to exercise any other politicalrights. They are recognized as inhabitants, andprotected as such in the enjoyment of all their rightsof person and properly. Whilst we protect thosewho are there, and their posterity, we do not intendto be inundated by colonies of negroes from otherStates, sent to us in order to get rid of the trouble ofthem at home. OUGLAS.         It is for this reason that Illinois has adopted thissystem of legislation, and, having adopted it, we donot desire to insist on it, unless it is consistent withthe Constitution of the United States. We are willingto have that question tested. We invite anygentleman who deems it right to oppose these lawsto bring his suit. We will furnish him all facilitiesfor having the question decided, and then we shallknow whether the right exists or not. I would muchhave preferred that this question should have arisenbetween two of the free States of the Union, wherethere would have been no prejudices or sectionaljealousies, or other improper motives to enter into itto bias our judgments and excite our passions, thanto see it arrayed here as one of the sectional questionsbetween the North and the South.
