 ☞The opening lecture before the Lyceum, onFriday evening, was delivered by Edwin P. Whipple,Esq., of Boston. His subject was, 'Young Men inHistory.' We listened to him for a few moments. After passing in review the young men of the FrenchRevolution of 1794, the lecturer said, if he was calledupon to name his beau ideal of all that is heroicin statesmanship, all that is elevated in patriotism,all that is graceful in oratory, all that is perfect inmanhood, all that is noble in idea and sentiment—he should name—whom do you suppose? WashingtonJefferson? Hamilton? Jackson? Clay?Revolution of 1794, the lecture said, if he was calledupon to name his beau ideal of all that is beforein statesmanship, all that is elevated in patriotism,all that is graceful in oratory, all that is perfect inmanhood, all that is noble in idea and sentiment heshould name—whom do you suppose? Washington?Jefferson? Hamilton? Jackson? Clay?Whether? Benton? Everett?—none of these —butCharles Sumner! This brought down the BlackRepublican side of the house. The applause was acommentary on the propriety of the reference.Having more important business on hand, we deniedcarselves the benefit of listening to the latter part ofthe discourse, the 'young men' in other histories besidesour own would stand a 'right smart chance'of getting injustice done them. This Mr. Whippleevidently estimates character by a different rule fromthat usually applied—adopting the abolition standardas the test of merit. The lecture was generallyregarded as a slim affair, and the lecture himself asa 'poor shot.' But we hope lyceum-goers willnot be discouraged by this failure. Let them takeheart from the adage, that 'a poor beginningmakes a good ending.—Augusta (Me.) Age, December10. beau ideal beau ideal Charles Sumner
