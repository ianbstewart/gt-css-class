 ☞'The free States are the guardians and essentialsupports of slavery. We are the jailers and constables of the institution. . . . There is some excusefor communities, when, under a generous impulse,they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States,and by force restor their rights; but they are withoutcourse in holding other States in binding on man onunrighteous yoke. On this subject, OUR FATHERS, INFRAMING THE CONSTITUTION, SWERVED FROM THE RIGHT.  We their children, at the end of half a century,see the path of duty more closely than they,and must with in it. To this point the public mindhas long been tending, and the time has come for lookingat it fully, dispencionetely, and with manly andChristian resolution. . . No blessing of the Unioncan be a compensation for taking part in the enslavingof our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to beperpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that itcan only continue through our participation in wrongdoing. To this conviction the free States are tending.— WILLIAM ELLERY CHANRINE. holding other States in binding on man onunrighteous yoke. ILLIAM LLERY HANRINE.
