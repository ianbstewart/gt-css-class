 What is a copperhead? A crawling animal, ever supple, creating nothing,breaking nothing, but destroying every thing ittouches. What is most like a copperhead? Lincoln's administration. Why? Because crawling with regard to foreign powers,supple and humble as regards parties, incapable ofcreating popular enthusiasm and credit, as well asof crushing the rebellion, it has destroyed all it hastouched—national honor and dignity abroad, prosperityand liberty at home. What is a factionist? A man who, from any personal feeling whatever,sacrifices his country to his person, instead of sacrificinghis person to his country. Who is the principal factionis: in the UnitedStates? Jefferson Davis. Who is the second? Lincoln. Why? Because he has not hesitated to sacrifice to hispersonal ambition the union of patriots so indispensableto the maintenance of the unity of the free institutionsof his country. What factionists come after him?. Contractors and other privileged persons unitedat Baltimore to make sure of the benefits they acquirethrough the Administration, by prolonging itsduration at the expense of the people. Is Fremont a factionist? No, for Fremont has spontaneously offered to retireto make room for any patriot, who by his antecedentswould be neither a danger, a shame, nor athreat to the institutions of his country. Are the men who are united at Cleveland factionists? No, for they have preceded every other manifestationof popular will, and constitute, up to thepresent day, the only real and disinterested manifestationof the people; strangers to all contracts, toall privileges, who sustain the nation by their toil,their taxes, their blood, and in going to Clevelandthey could have no other interest than that of controllingthe effect and making certain the success ofthe sacrifices they impose upon themselves for thedefence of the country—New Nation. New Nation.
