 Whether the people ought so to feel or not, wewill not now discuss; but of the fact there can be nomistake, that Gen. Fremont lost ground in the estimationof the people when he declined to serve hiscountry under Gen. Pope, in the Virginia campaign.He had a right to ask to be relieved of his command,we know; but after all, it was an indication that hewas not as patriotic as he should have been—that hisown personality, in his mind, was to be first regarded,and afterwards his country's welfare. His resignationof his Major Generalship, to have had thegrace of patriotism—of being unwilling to draw paywhen he was doing no service for his country—should -have been sent in weeks or months ago, beforehe received the nomination of the ClevelandConvention. Now it must be confessed as only a partof a scheme to divide the Union vote in the comingpolitical contest. It were well for Gen. Fremont toconsider that no man in the nation stands so high inthe estimation of the people that he  safely layclaim to personal consideration, either in being promotedto a high office, or in the gratification of hispersonal feelings at defeating others, before the welfareof the nation. To stand well with the peoplein a crisis like this, or in subsequent history, a manmust act in pure subordination to the paramount interestsof his country.  Now, either Gen. Fremont is no accurate observerof public sentiment as it exists, or he would see andknow that the mass of Union voters think best, underall the circumstances, to re-nominate and electAbraham Lincoln. He has been educated in theconduct of our affairs at a great expense to the nation,and there are substantial reasons why the chivalryof the South should be subdued under the sameadministration under which it revolted. After somevexations and expensive delays, of which Gen. Fremontwas the occasion of full his share, the war isnow being prosecuted with energy and success. Thepeople, for the time being at least, believe that nochange could be made for the better in the person ofoar President or commanders. And believing this,they observe, some with mortified and tome with indignantfeelings, the attempt to which Gen. Fremontis giving his countenance to divide the Union vote.The loyal voters of the nation feel the necessity ofacting together in the coming election, and they willnot be divided. The current has set in strong forMr. Lincoln's re-nomination, and whether history,will vindicate the wisdom of the popular choice, wecannot know at present; but the fact being so, Gen.Fremont, with every Union man in the nation, oughtto regard it, and rather than risk anything througha division of our voting forces, cooperate in themovement. Gen. Fremont's opportunity, now lost by his letterof acceptance, was most obvious. When he receivedthe official notice of his nomination at Cleveland, heshould have written a patriotic letter declining it,and spoken such good and strong words for the Administrationas its vigorous efforts to crash the rebellionwarrant him in uttering, and went to work forhis country is subordination to the manifest wish ofthe people, and he would have done much to redeemhis error in throwing up his command under Pope,and again stood well with his countrymen. He mightnot ever have been President, but in this he wouldhave been no worse off than Webster, or Clay, orSeward, or Douglas, or Banks, or a hundred othereminent men who have had their eyes fixed on thisgoal of American ambition. His measure of glorywould have been well-filled in his stupendous explorations,his being the unsolicited candidate of thegreat party of Freedom, when it made its first gallantcharge under his leadership upon the cohorts ofslavery—in his vast and illimitable welath—and innow proving himself to be  in the of p c above personal for office and more than all able to cthe  of  for the  or real inhe may have  for his country. HadGen. F and upon a heartysupport of the  of the  C would have  in of statesmen, and patriots, than he can by any aide effortfor the Presidency, which, after all, the worldwill be sure to interpret as an act of revenge onPresident Lincoln. Such a course might be overlookedin hoys and entail men, but it will neveranswer the ends of a just and noble ambition.                    In his letter of acceptance, be travels out of hisway to spite President Lincoln, and for want of bettergrounds of accusation, appropriates to his usethe stale trash of the Copperheads—distorting thewell-intended acts of the Administration to suppressthe rebellion and keep mischief-makers from incitingriot and encouraging the rebellion, into monstrousacts of "tyranny," "usurpation," and "oppression."These accusations, coming from Gen. Fremont, manyof whose acts as commander of the Department ofMissouri, were without the sanction of civil or militarylaw, but which were justified on the ground ofmilitary necessity, make it manifest that the Generalseizes upon these charges of the Copperheads asa pretext for his course, when, in fact, be caresnothing for them, and knows that they no more endangerour civil liberties than his selection of foreignersfor his military staff was turning the governmentover to foreign powers. These accusations are buta pretext, a subterfuge, under which to cloak his personalrevenge. Well, it won't work. "The bitterchalice will return to plague the inventor," and whenelection is over, Gen. Fremont will count himself ablunderbuss in political strategy, and bitterly lamenthis folly in acting so unworthy of the place be seeks.—.N.Y. Reformer. N.Y. Reformer.
