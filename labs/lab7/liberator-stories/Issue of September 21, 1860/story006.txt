 A late mail from American bore the startling intelligencethat the chronic conflict which has beenon long maintained between the Slaveocracy andDemocracy of the Republic has, at length, assumedsuch dimensions, and risen to such a pitch,that the Southern States have resolved to separatefrom the Northern, and a distinct Republic,the cause assigned being the aggressive action andextent of the Abolition agitation. It is likewisereported that emissaries have been dispatched toEurope for the purpose of sounding the differentGovernments as to the part they would be likely totake, were immediate steps adopted to lead to theconsummation of this project. Considering, however,the popular aspirations of the American people,their indigenous appetite for annexation, andtheir deep-grounded belief that it is their manifestdestiny virtually to absorb the entire Continentand its Islands, there are strong reasons for discrediting,if not the existence of a movement tendingto this result on the part of the Shorthorns, thepossibility of its ever being carried into effect.Another improbability also attaching to this importantpiece of intelligence is found in the fact,that the influence of the Slaveocracy has, of lateyears, become so augmented in Congress as to approximateto a virtual command of that assembly.The America of the present day presents not onlythe most extraordinary phenomena of a national existencewhich can be found in universal history, butaffords, in its future aspect, the moat difficult problemfor the prospective politician—a vast centre andsystem of civilization, yet composed of the moat antagonisticelements—liberty in its most advancedand exaggerated form at one pole, slavery at theother; nineteenth century progress reigning paramountin the North; Egyptian despotism, such asexisted in the barbarian days which saw the pyramidsarise, in the South; commerce advancing withthe rapidity of steam, yet producing opulent resultsas transitory; education spreading like light,yet incapable of dissipating the cloud which hangsover Carolina; a Christianized people holding fourmillions of their fellow-creatures in servitude;formidable to the universe as a nation, yet, fromthe latter iniquitous element of their condition, dividedagainst themselves. For the present, despitethe agitation of the Northern Democrats, thereseems little likelihood that that separation is aproximate possibility, or that it will occur as longas America is in a transition state consequent onformation. Should, however, a breach between theNorthern and Southern States assume a probableaspect, there can be but little doubt that their disunionwould be sedulously fostered by Europeangovernments, despotic and Constitutional—the latterof which would very likely side with the South,as well at England, whose commercial interests,which invariably dictate her foreign policy, liechiefly in the latter division of the Republic, andwho would hardly object to see broken up a Powerwhich, already vast, threatens at no distant day toannek Canada.
