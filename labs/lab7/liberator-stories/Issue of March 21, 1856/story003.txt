 'The course of Anti-Slavery lectures, or lectureson slavery as they were styled, was bro't to n closelast weekly by a discourse from E.P. Whipple. Esq.The Tremont Temple was about half full, and thelecturer less at home than when discoursing uponlibrary subjects. The following from a full reportof the lecture will give a general idea of Mr.W.'smoral views: "It should never be forgotten thatslavery rests fundamentally upon the audacious,inhuman and self-evident lie that property can beheld in man." It is not to be supposed that inthis sentence the lecturer intended to deny the historicalfact that property, according to human laws,has always been held in man. The facts of theCreator permitting the holding of such property,in certain cases, in the Old Testament, and ofPaul's recognizing it in the New, by laying downrules to govern the master and servant, perhapsMr.W. will be inclined to consider in connectionwith his assertion, that he may see clearly who hasuttered "an audacious lie." Once can say thusmuch by simply being true to the Bible, withoutjustifying a single evil connected with slaveholding,or denying that slavery is to be amelioratedunder the bright-shining light of the Gospol, andin the end suffer an easy death.'â€”Boston correspondentof the N.Y.
