 THE U.S. CONSITTUTION IS 'A COVENANT WITH DEATHAND AN AGREEMENT WITH NELL.' ☞Yes! IT CANNOT IS DENIED—the slaveholdinglords of the south prescribed, as a condition of theirassent to the Constitution, three special provisions toSECURE THE PERPETUITY OF THEIR DOMINION OVER SLAVES. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African above trade; the seed wasTHE STIPULATION TO SURRENDER FUGITIVE SLAVED—onengagement positively prohibited by the laws of Goddelivered from Sinai; and thirdly, the exaction, fatalto the principle of popular representation, of a representationfor SLAVES—for articles of merchandize, underthe name of persons . . . . in fact, the oppressor representingthe oppressed! . . . . To call government thus constituteda democracy, is to insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and Slavery. Its reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of the nation is to establish an arterialmajority in the slave representation over that of thefree people, in the American Congress; AND TO MAKE THE PRESERVATION, PROPACATION AND PERPETUATIONOF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANTIMATING SPRIRTOF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.'—John Quincy Adams.
