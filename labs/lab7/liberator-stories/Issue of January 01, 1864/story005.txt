 Extremes meet. The "Radical Abolitionist"and the Radical Democracy are of accord. Bothgrowl at the Administration; both denounce the"conduct of the war;" both devote themselves topeddling slanders about the heads of Government;both denounce with equal coarseness, and equal affluenceof vituperative language, the President's lastProclamation. The Argus and GARRISON'S Liberatorare equally unhappy over its issue, equally denunciatoryof its author, and equally positive in theirpredictions that it will work evil instead of good.The former stigmatizes it as wicked and "revolutionary;"the latter sneers at it as "uncalled for,""Anti-Republican" and "perilous." Both are agreedthat it is a very bad measure, that it was inspiredby very bad motives, that it threatens to play themischief with their favorite hobbies, and that it oughtto be promptly recalled. both denounce with equal coarseness, and equal affluenceof vituperative language, the President's lastProclamation. Argus ARRISON'S Liberator The Argus and the Liberator see through the samepair of spectacles, and harp upon the same string.The motive is dissimilar; the end sought for is widelydifferent; but the attack is made with the sameweapons. Argus Liberator Nor is the Liberator the only co-laborer of the Democracyin the war on the President's scheme ofamnesty. WENDELL PHILLIPS takes the field, andlaunches against it the thunders of his matchless butperverted eloquence. Liberator ENDELL HILLIPS Thus the impracticable and fanatics on both sidesjoin hands in a common crusade against the President'splan. This, in itself, is convincing evidencethat it has virtue in it. It, moreover, refutes thecharge that it is an "extreme" or "revolutionary"measure.â€”Albany Evening Journal. Albany Evening Journal.
