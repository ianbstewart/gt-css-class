 We see by the eastern papers, that the abolitiondiunionists of that section are about to resumetheir old habit of flooding the country with itineratinglecturers to poison the public mind, by preachingthe beauties of the negro race. The AmericanAnti-slavery Society makes no secret of the intention.It says an additional number of these lecturershave been employed, and calls on all "lovers offreedom" to send cash contributions to keep themin the field. We shall have the old re-inforced by a still hungnerswarm of broken-down clergy men, whilom disunionistswomen, negroes, Sunday politicians, spiritualists,and free-lovers. These, and such as these,will probably visit every nook and corner of theland this winter as teachers of the American people.The more these men have denounced churches religions,bibles, laws, the Constitution and the Union,the greater will be their anticipated reward, in theway of popular adoration. Is the end never to come? Will the Americanpeople never give over their systematic worship ofhumbug? Can the day be far distant when thesenorthern preachers and lecturers, who have spenttheir life-time in seeking to subvert and overthrowthe Union of the American States, shall be lookedupon as moral monstrosities?â€”Milwaukee News.
