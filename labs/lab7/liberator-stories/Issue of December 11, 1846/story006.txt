 ☞ All men are born free and equal—with cer-tain natural, essential and unalienable rights—amongwhich are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ☞ Three millions of the American people are inchains and slavery—held as chattels personal, andbought and sold as marketable commodities. ☞ Seventy thousand infants, the offspring of slaveparents, kidnapped as soon as born, and permanentlyadded to the slave population of Christian,(!) Republican,(!!) Democratic(!!!) America every year. ☞ Immediate, Unconditional Emancipations. ☞ Slave-holders, Slave-traders and Slave-drivesare to be placed on the same level of infamy, and inthe same fiendish category, as kidnapped and men-stealer— a race of monsters unparalelled in their assumptionof power, and their despotic cruelty. ☞ The existing Constitution of the United States is'a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell. NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS!
