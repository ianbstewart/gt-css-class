 On Saturday, June 28th, Mr. Webster partook ofa public dinner at Capon Springs, in Virginia. Thefollowing was among the toasts given on the cocanes:— Daniel Webster, our distinguished guest: Thejurist and statesman, who has illustrated the glory ofour country. The champion of the Constitution andthe Union, who has sown the seed of constitutionalliberty broadcast over the civilized world. To the following toast, Mr. Webster rose to respondamid deafening applause. He said: Ladies and Gentlemen—Fellow-citizens of Virgines,—It is my first duty to express, however inadequatelymy gratitude to you, one an d all for thisunexpected taken of respect. I am aware that manyof you have come from great distances, many ofyou I know have come upon the saddle, under aburning sun, and you have done this to tender methis token of your regard. I know, also, that manyof you have left your estates and harvest-fields at atime when every hour, whether to a proprietor orworkman, is so important. For this gentlemen, Ithank you. I am afraid this courtesy, which youhave extended to me, has been to you costly and incontinentand therefore gentlemen, it sinkmore deeply into my heart. I thank you, gentlemen. It has been my fortune, gentlemen, to have seenmuch of Eastern Virginia and of Southern Virginia;in past times also gentlemen, I have seen somethingof Western Virginia, those counties borderingon the Ohio river; but not until this week, gentlemenwas it my fortune to have seen any thing ofthe beautiful and renowned Valley where I nowstand. I esteem it as my great fortune to have hada few day's leisure, or, at least, a few days that Icould spare from my official duties, to follow thecourse of the Potomac, penetrate the Blue Ridge,and turning to the left along the valley of the Shenandoah,see something of the country between theBlue Ridge and the Alleghany. My journey throughyour county thus far has been one of great pleasureand admiration. I am free to confess that from thetime I crossed the Potomac, and, leaving it, wentwith the train upwards along the valley of the Shenandoah,I have seen a country abounding in fertilityand remarkable for its vast richness and bounty.[Applause]. I have seen the great grain-growingcountry of New York, and of Ohio and other WesternStates; of England, from Hertfordshire to theborders of Scotland, but I have never seen anything surpassing that which I crossed from thetime I left Harper's Ferry till I reached Winchester.I have been told that the same rich country extendsbeyond, and is to be found through Shenandoah,Rockingham, and Augusta countries. I hope, gentlemen,soon to have an opportunity of witnessingthe truth of that statement. [Applause.] I admire,too, your mountain scenery; I admire it, too, for itssublimity and grandeur; though, perhaps thosemountains are not adapted to that high degree ofcultivation for which the valley is so remarkable,still, they are picturesque, and give rise to thoughtsand feelings which tend to elevate and dignify theman who beholds them. I assure you, gentlemenI would feel most happy, if my time would permit,—and I hope before long I may have the opportunityto proceed still further in this regions of the State,—to go westward to the banks of the South Branchof the Potomac, and see that great corn-growing andcattle—raising country, of which I have heard and ofwhich I have read so much for nearly half my life.[Applause.] But this, at present, my time will notallow. This is my first visit to this part of Virginia,but I hope, gentlemen, it will not be the last. [Applause.] There are two things which constitute a country;soil and climate are one, men and women the other.[Laughter.] Here they are both to be found. But,even if there were so men and women in this regionthe country would still be valuable and beautiful;and if it were as barren as yonder rock,(promoting to a jutting cliff which overhangs thespring) but was filled with intelligent men, and refinedand educated women, like those who nowthrong this wide hall, it would be most admirablestill. So if either were here, your country wouldbe beautiful and fascinating and you, gentlemenknow how fascinating it must be when both are sohappily combined. [Great applause.] But I must now turn my attention to the toastwhich has been read by my friend—a friend of longstanding—at the head of the table. I must attributeto learn to the partiality of friendship and I am surethey are somewhat extravagant. I disclaims havingdone any thing in support and defence, and in themaintenance of, the Constitution, except what Ihave done in co-operation with other abler men:with men of high character and true devotion totheir country and its political institutions. [Applause]I was bred, gentlemen,—indeed, I mightalmost say I was born,—in admiration of our politicalinstitutions. I have studied long, and in facthave studied little else of a political nature. All thepublic acts of my life have been performed in theservice of the General Government. I have neverhad any office under any State Government, and,into the exception of a few days only, I have neverbeen a member of a State Legislature. I am asyou may know, a lawyer and from necessity, a laborone. I know not how the bread of idlenesstastes, for I have never had a bit of it in my mouth.[Great applause.] This, perhaps, savors of self-commendation;but I hope it may be pardoned. If,in the discharge of my public duties and in the performanceof my public services, my private interesthave suffered and been neglected, I am amply compensatedby the hope that if I leave no broad estate,no rich accumulations, I shall leave at least an inheritancenot entirely disreputable to those who shallcome after me. [Enthusiastic applause.] I profess, gentlemen, to have acted throughoutmy life upon those principle which governed yourancestors and my own New England ancestors inthe times that tried men's souls; that is to say, inthe revolutionary struggle, and in that other mostimportant period which witnessed the establishmentof a General Government. All know that in thislast high and important proceeding. Virginia tookas lead. She saw that, to the disgrace of thecountry, the debt of the revolution remained unpaidand that gallant officers and brave soldiers, who hadbrought wounds and scars and broken limbs from thebattle side of liberty, were reduced to poverty andwent, and some of them almost literally beggingtheir bound. The great and good men of other statesfelt the same evil, and their hearts were wrog bya similar anguish.  An English poet has said, that there was a timevise, for an Englishmen it was same enough. 'That Chatam's language was his native taAnd Wolfe's great name competites with his wear.  Now, gentlemen, it is fame enough for me, if hemay be thought that in my political conduct I havecontinued, defended and acted upon the principleof Virginia and Massachusetts as these principles wereproclaimed and sustained by the two greatepochs in the history of our country—the Revolutionand the adoption of the prompt countryGovernment. If I have, working steadily for thisend, Paid were that, whether much has been done orsettle his down true, it has been directed towards agood purpose. [Land applause.] All that I may inday and all that I may say on similar occasion Iwish to be in the spirit of Washington and Madison.Wythe and Pendleton , and the proscribed patriotsof Massachusetts, Francois and Samuel Adams.[Applause.] If these and other great founded ofour liberty and fathers of our Constitutions erred,then have I erred; then, I have been the most incorrigibleof political sinners. [Laughter.] But if theywere right then I venture to hope that I am rightalso; and neither principalities nor powers, northings present nor things to come, shall eradicate theirhope from my breast. [Loud and enthusiastic charing.] The leading sentiment in the teats from the chairis the Union of the States. THE UNION OF THESTATES! What mind can comprehend the consequenceof that Union, past, present, and to come?The Union of these States is the all-absorbing topicof the day; on its all men write, speak, think, acutefrom the rising of the sun to the going down thereof.(Applause.) And yet, gentlemen, I fear its importancehas been but insufficiently appreciated.—Like all common blessings, however great, it hasbeen of late years too little the subject of reflection.The unthinking and careless hardly take freedof that atmosphere which supports their lives fromday to day, and from hour to hour. As the su in the morning, follows its path through the beavensand goes down at night, we notice its cores,enjoy its light and heat, and when we see it sinkbeneath the western horizon, we have no doubt, wedo not think of the possibility that it may not appearfor another day. WE are in no fear of perpetualdarkness, or the return of chaos. Se it is with ourpolitical system under a United Government andNational Constitution. To these most of us wereborn; we have lived under their daily blessings, asif those blessings were not early metters of con but imperishably also. But always gentlemen humanstructure however strong, do not stand upon theeeverlasting laws of nature. They may strugglethey may fall, and republican institutions of governmentwill assuredly sooner or later crumble and fall, ifthere shall not continue to be among the people inintelligent regard for such institutions, a great appositionof their benefit, and a spirit purposeto uphold and maintain them. And when they shallcrumble and fall, the political catastrophe would resemblethat which would happen in the naturalworld, were the sun to be streak out of heaven. Ifthis Union, were to be brokers up by nullification separationrecession, or whatever event of equallyrepulsive name and character, chaos would comeagain and where all is now light and joy and gladnessthere would be spread over us a darkness likethat of Erebus. yet gentlemen I have little patiencewith these who talk flippantly of secondaryand disunion; they do not appear to understandwhat they do not have the least idea of its consequencesIf they have any meaning, I do not comprehendthat meaning. Suppose this Union were dissolvedtoday, where would we be to-morrow? I think a stateof things would arrive in which I should feel disputedto take shelter in the caverns of the mountainous orseek some other place of obscurity in which I shouldnot witness the degradation and ruin of the country.Every such anticipation presents a gloomy and picture; it a vast Serbonian bog. I never sawa happy man in it, unless he was about getting out.How could a man be happy in it hospitably up to hismiddle in mud? [Great laughter.] Those wholove the Union ardently, and who mean to de it gallantly, are happy cheerful, with bright andbuoyant hopes for the future, and full of manly and resolution. But secession and di  area region of gloose and morns and  no chessfulbreezes fan it, we spirit of health visits it it isall malaria. It is all fever and ague. [Laughterand great applause.] Nothing beautiful or usefulgrows in it; the Traveller through it breathes and tread among every thing woodennesses andloathsome. It is like the region of your great. DismalSwamp; it is all HE NION TATES         'Tangled juniper, heds of words,With many a fen where the corpent feeds,And man never trod before.' [Laughter.]   For one, I have no desire to breathe such an sisor have such footing for my walks. (Applause.) Gentlemen, I am aware that the respect paid tome to-day is in consequence of my support of theadjustment measures of the last Congress. AlthoughI wished to raise no false  nor crimeany fears, yet I believed in my concession that incrimes was at hand; a dang  fearful crisis andI resolved to meet it, at any hazard, and with whateverstrength I possessed. A true petrict, like afaithful mariner, must be prepared for all exercisein the words of the old song—   —'He is born for all weathers;Let the whole How high or blow low,His duty keeps him to his elbow,And where the sale drive he must go.'    (Applause) The support of the Union is a greatfractional subject, involving the prosperity and flouryof the whole country, and affecting the property ofevery individual in it. We are about to take a largeand comprehensive view of it, to look so its vast result,and to the consequence which would flowfrom its c . It is not to save topic for it disquisition, or theoretical or fanatical orlicism.Those who assail the Union at the presentday seem to be persons of and idea only, ad manyof those but half an idea. (Applause.) They planttheir b  some  futuredegrees or some gratitude . Or perhapsit may be more proper to say that look at itwith microscopic eyes, cooking for some apt,or speech, or blot, or abler, and if they find any thingof his kind, they are at once for everything thewhose fabric.

(Applauses.) Mr. WARBSTER said—I am  to hear of devotion to the Union expressed by Mr. who, as I understand, has differed from meupon many subjects, as many other respectable andworthy men have done. But whatever may havebarn the different of opinion which have existedbetween us heretofore, on other subjects, they arenow forgotten, and the early question that is asked of any men is, are you a Union  (Grandobserving.) The question at this  in the Union,and how to preserve its blessing for the present, andfor all time to came. To preserve that Union wemost observe in good faith, the Constitution and allits parts. If that Constitution be not observed and provisions set  the while of it  to be It would be  to suppose that eitherthe North or the South has the power or the rightto  any part of that Constitution and thenclaim from the other observance of its provisions(Applause.)
