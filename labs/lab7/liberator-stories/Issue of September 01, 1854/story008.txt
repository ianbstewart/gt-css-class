 Not having room for it, in our last number, we wereobliged to postpone the following portion of Mr. FARMER'Saccount of the proceedings of the Anti-SlaveryConference at Manchester, in reference to Mr. BARKER:— ARMER ARKER Mr. BARKER suddenly ascending the platform, said—I have only five minutes to remain in this meeting beforemy train starts; and I wish to speak before I go.'(Cries of 'no, no,' 'Ward, Ward.') ARKER The CHAIRMAN— The Rev. S.R. Ward is appointedto address the meeting next. ('Hear, hear.') HAIRMAN Rev. S.R. WARD— Let the sense of this meeting— aBritish meeting— determine what is the next order ofthe day. To that decision, I am quite willing to bow. ARD Rev. W. PARKERS— As one of the Secretaries, I begto say, that I engaged Mr. Ward to address the Conferencenext. ARKERS Mr. BARKER— I have only five minutes left, and Iwish to make one statement. (Cries of 'no, no.') Ihave made the offer; that is sufficient. I do not wishto press the matter. ARKER Mr. POWELL— I believe this meeting represents allclasses of abolitionists. I hope you will not make aninvidious distinction upon your platform. I know thatmy friend Ward, if a consistent anti-slavery man anda consistent colored man, will waive his right, (I say itwith all due respect to the regulations which have beenmade for the speakers,) and allow my friend Barker tospeak. It does not matter what he may be in his religiousopinions, if he says anything in behalf of the slave.I know that Mr. Ward will, if a consistent advocate ofthe emancipation of the slave, waive his right. Leteach one judge upon matters of religion for himself. OWELL Mr. BARKER— If the meeting will allow me to speaktwo minutes, I shall be satisfied. (Cries of 'Hear,hear,' met with almost general cries of 'No, no.') ARKER Rev. S.A. STENTHAL— Let Mr. Barker speak, by allmeans; he has a right to do so. (Cries of 'No, no.') TENTHAL The Rev. Dr. McKERROW— Sir, I rise to order. (Thenoise and confusion were so great at this moment, thatthe Reverend gentleman could not be heard.) ERROW Mr. POWELL— This is an open platform. We oughtto permit every one to be heard, if he agrees in our fundamentalprinciples. OWELL The CHAIRMAN— I must differ from that view of thecase. I think the officers of this meeting have the orderand arrangement of the public speakers. For myown part, if I was in the place of the individual nowattempting to speak, I should think it unbecoming ofme, as a gentleman and a Christian, to interrupt themeeting in this manner. HAIRMAN Mr. BARKER (having descended from the platform,and ascended a seat in the body of the room)— No officerhas a right to stop a speaker, unless he is excludedfrom speaking. On the ground of the first resolutionpassed in this meeting, I claim a right to speak oneminute, which is now about the only time I have left.(Cries of 'Chair, chair,' 'Order, order,' and greatconfusion.) ARKER Rev. Dr. McKERROW— you can express your sentimentsat the proper time. ERROW Mr. BARKER— As long as I have been in the habit ofattending public meeting— (The remainder of the sentencewas drowned in cries of 'Chair, chair,' and inthe general confusion.) ARKER The CHAIRMAN— Mr. Ward will address the meeting. HAIRMAN Mr. BARKER, still standing upon the seat with Mr.Steinthal by his side, again essayed to speak, but invain. ARKER Dr. McKERROW— I rise to a point of order. I haveno desire to express my sentiments as to who isto speak, whether Mr. Ward or Mr. Barker;but this I say, that it is the custom in Manchester tomake previous arrangement for the order of the meeting.If any individual, after the proceedings have beenbrought to a close, obtains the permission of the meetingto address the auditory, then it is all right; but noone has a right to stand up, and interfere with the orderof the proceedings, as previously settled. ERROW Mr. BARKER— The first resolution states, that all personswho believe slaveholding to be a sin, and immediateemancipation to be the right of the slave and theduty of the master, shall be eligible to be a member ofthis conference, and take part in its deliberations. Thisresolution passed unanimously. I asked only fire minutesto speak to this resolution. I shall speak to thismeeting to the extent to which my voice will reachthem. (Mr. Barker then attempted to make himselfheard, but the noise from the stamping of feet, knockingof sticks and umbrellas, and cries of 'Chair,' completelydrowned his voice.) ARKER Mr. POWELL— I rise to a point of order. This is amost extraordinary course of proceeding. OWELL Mr. BARKER— I am unwilling to allow the subject ofthis resolution to pass, without endeavoring to give utteranceto my feelings against slavery, and in favor ofabolitionism. (Cries of 'Chair,chair!' 'Order, order!''Ward, Ward!') My children will read the report ofthis meeting. (Cries of 'Chair,' and hisses.) TheAmerican abolitionists will read the report of this meeting,and will see that I have not been heard. ARKER Mr. OLDHAM— Mr. Barker has a right to be heard.He comes within the first resolution. LDHAM Mr. BARKER— My children will read the report ofthis meeting. (Hisses, noise, and great confusion, duringwhich Mr. Steinthal endeavored to speak, but couldnot gain a hearing.) ARKER Mr. BARKER— This conduct is most infamous. I amsorry that it should take place among abolitionists.—(Cries of 'Chair, chair,' and hisses.) ARKER Mr. OLDHAM.— This conduct is disgraceful to theConference. The Chairman ought to have allowed himto speak. LDHAM. Mr. BARKER again attempted to address the meeting,but except to those who were close to him, the attemptwas dumb show. (Cries of 'Chair, chair,' 'Put himout.') Mr. Barker then left the meeting. After silencehad been restored. ARKER Mr. THOMPSON rose and said— I think we have all ofus continued some little error in this matter. It wasan error upon the part of Mr. Barker to insist upontaking precedence of Mr. Ward, simply in consequenceof the resolution that we passed this morning, becausewhile that resolution recognizes distinctly the right ofevery person to speak in this meeting, so long as hespeaks to the question and to the objects of themeeting,— that is, every person who should subscribeto the fundamental principle of the sinfulness ofslavery, and the duty of immediate emancipation, — yetI do not think that more subscription to that preliminaryresolution necessarily gave him the right to set aside thearrangements of the officers of the meeting, and to puthimself between Mr. Ward and this audience. (Hear,hear.) At the same time, I think there has been someerror committed, if the opposition to Mr. Barker hasarisen out of any dislike to the peculiar opinions knowsto be entertained by that gentleman. We ought to beconsistent with the great principles which we laid downas our rule of association, when we came into this meeting.We should not have allowed any differences ofopinion with Mr. Barker on any question to have preventedour hearing him. (Cries of 'No, no!' 'Wedeny it!')! HOMPSON Rev. Mr. ROGERS— I deny that there her, Mr. Thompson.You are not fairly representing us. OGERS with  that I have  the right of everyhuman being. who ever attended any meeting of myown, to express no opinion, while be expressed it in relationto the subject under                 The CHAIRMAN— I beg have to say, in vindication ofmyself and the course I have taken an chairman, thatour friend Ward had to leave, for the purpose of attendinganother meeting at Leeds this evening. Therewas very little time for him to deliver his speech beforethe train went. I am as liberal as Mr. Thompson,with regard to matters of opinion. I maintain that Mr.Barker had no right to come upon this platform, andinterrupt the order of the meeting. (Hear, hear.) Ifhe had waited his time, we should all have heard himspeak without interruption. HAIRMAN Mr. OLAHAN—He only asked for five minutes, and hewas not allowed to have that. The noise which wasmade to drown his voice was disgraceful. LAHAN Mr. STEINTHAL—Hear, hear. (Cries of 'no, no.') TEINTHAL Rev. Mr. ROGERS—I deny that any one opposed Mr.Barker out of any consideration for his peculiar religiousopinions. If he had chosen to speak in order withproper deference to the chair, I am one who would havesupported his being heard. The resolutions were moved,but they should have been seconded. After that, itwould have been perfectly competent to any one to haverisen, but, until then, it was a clear violation of theorder of the meeting. OGERS The Rev. Dr. BEARD— As one of the managers of themeeting, I feel myself bound to make a remark. Mr.Barker's presence was noticed at an early period of themeeting. (Hear, hear.) It was thought he mightwish to speak, and two or three of the managersof the meeting talked the matter over one withanother; and it was resolved that if he wished tospeak, he should speak. (Hear.) I beg that I mayhave the attention of the Conference to this statement.There was no intention whatever to exclude Mr. Barker,and the only requirement or modification in his casewas. that, should he enter into matters alien to thebusiness of the Conference, he should be called to order.Now, had Mr. Barker not interfered between Mr. Ward,who was compelled to retire, and who had been askedto speak, I would have been the first to stand up andclaim for him five minutes, or a quarter of an hour. Ifhe had intimated that he was desirous of speaking,some arrangement would have been made. EARD Mr. OLDHAM— An arrangement was made that hewas not allowed to speak. LDHAM Dr. BEARD— Allow me, sir. I am in possession of thechair. An arrangement was made that he should beallowed to speak, as long as he confined himself to theobject the meeting had in view in coming together. Myfriend Mr. Thompson makes a mistake, if he in anyway intimated that there was the slightest possible compromiseof the breadth of our platform. I will disownit altogether when it is not a free platform. As far as Idid anything, I used my influence to keep it free; but,at teh same time, I am not a friend of disorder. EARD Dr. MC KERRCW—I am an advocate, to the fullest extent,for civil and religious freedom, whatever diversityof sentiment may exist amongst us here, with regard toreligious matters. I do not think we have to do herewith discussions about creeds. This is a great questionof human right, and human suffering, and human liberties, and the platform is broad enough for us all tostand upon. I would not have object to Mr. Barkeraddressing this meeting; but I have had some littleintercourse with Manchester people, and know somethingof the arrangements of Manchester meetings, and Isay that it is understood perfectly among us, that whenarrangements are made, no one has a right to interferewith them; but that, at the conclusion of the meeting,if any one desire to speak, or an amendment is proposedto the resolution, an opportunity may be afforded. Irecollect well when we had a large meeting in the exchangeupon the education question, that Mr. Holyoakerose up, and asked permission to speak. As Secretaryof the meeting, I refused to hear him, simply on theground that arrangements were made for speakers, butI intimated that, at the close of the meeting, he mightspeak. Mr. Holyoake, whatever his sentiments mayhave been, acted with the courtesy of a gentleman uponthe occasion. (Cheers and partial hisses.) C ERRCW Thus ended this unpleasant episode in the proceedingsof this Conference. I never wrote anything in connectionwith the anti-slavery movement with so little relish;but as it may be contended by the friends of Mr.Barker, that the right of free speech was assailed uponthe occasion, I have given you such a detailed accountas I am able, of a discussion in which half-a-dozen weresometimes speaking at one time, in order that you mayjudge for yourself as to which of the parties was toblame, and who was responsible for the waste of suchvaluable time, and the interruption of the otherwiseperfect harmony of so important an Anti-Slavery Conference.
