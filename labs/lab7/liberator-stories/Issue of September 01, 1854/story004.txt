 An Anti-Slavery Conference has just been heldin the great cotton capital of England, the object ofwhich has been to utter an indignant condemnationof the great Republic's most glaring evil, and. athe same time, indicate the course of economicalrocedure which ought by Great Britain to be pur-ued.The object aimed at is two-fold—first, toell the American people, and especially the Americanchurches, the magnitude of their crime in retainingin cruel, degrading and disgusting bondagehree and a-half millions of their fellow and, secondly, to stir up in this country a demandrom the Government of the United Kingdom, that he administration of affairs in India be such as tolevelop the all but illimitable cotton-producingesources of that vast territory. The former ofthese methods of demonstration is in tended to  ourransatlantic cousins know that, while we admireheir country. their go-ahead freedom as Angloaxons,their commerce, their almost everything.ve stand in the dust of their African kindred— hat the more we look at their mingles in respect slavery, and especially as it mingles in the blood their churches, and is again sheltered under lesiasticalconnivance, the more do we deploreand abominate this most vile pollution in the politand social fabric in the United States—and we are resolved to let them hear of this men- contradiction on their soil—till, by American., it be lifted up and done away for ever.ttar method of aggression is to be by  gradually our dependence for the  States of the Union to the                                  New, whatever                  The former of  gentleman and only ed,with all  and , the  and the  dealers in human flesh, with revolting and shameless familiaritythe poor crouching victims of their cupidity, butthe  a sunder of the most  ties. The and her children weeping and olinging toeach other—separated— asunder as if therehad been no more humanity in the case than in theseparation of a butcher's herd. And the scenesthus witnessed were not the accidental far-betweeninstances of occasional evil, but the daily returningtraffic of Columbia's human shambles. No wonderMr. Bishop felt the boiling tide of indignation almosttoo much to restrain. It was the nativemovement of unbribed humanity. It was the homageof British freedom to the eternal laws whichrule the moral universe. And but for the debasinginfluence of familiarity with great crimes, therewas not a heart on the soil of Virginia, which, ifbrought into contact with the vile visage of slaveryfor the first time, and fresh from the genuine powerof Christian principle, but would have cursedthe unutterable evil thus daily enacted in the slave-marketof the South. It requires the contact of inusage to blunt the sense of the diabolicalwrong inflicted by slavery; and how terrible mustthe deadening process be, when Christian men andChristian ministers can stand by, in all meeknessand gentleness, without a shout of indignation asGod's redeemed creatures are made the sport andbutt, and vile commodity of drunken auctioneer!Mr. Pillsbury's reference to the tutoring which theaboriginal tribes—Choctaws, Cherokees, and soforth— have received at the hands of their republicanprotectors sets forth the flagrancy of Americanslaveholding in characteristic colors. TheseIndian imitators of the white man have passedlaws analogous to those which obtain in the slave-holdingStates. No teaching for the slave; noshelter for the runaway slave; no mercy to Africanflesh. Setting up a government for themselves,those tribes of the far West join hand in band withthe heartless spoliators, who hold in bondage thewoolly-headed Indians of another clime. So thatthe red men of the forest and the prairie are taughtto spurn and tread in the dust the poor children ofEthiopia. And, coupling with these signs of theslaveholder's might, the passage of the NebraskaBill, we can scarcely wonder that the darkest andmost indignant apprehensions arise as to the foulevil which taints the social and political action of thefederal Union. No wonder that such a conferencewas held; no wonder that such resolutions werepassed; and no wonder that such earnest expostulationswere emitted by the various speakers whodrew attention to America's wrong inflicted on herthree millions of slaves.              But prudence, and political sagacity, and non-interferenceof other States, and a thousand otherlazy, temporising shams, will arise and attempt tochoke the utterance of right. Look at home; yourown drunkenness, starving needle-women, andprowling, savage, untaught myriads—attend tothese—remove your own fetters, set your own socialand political fabric a right, and then look overthe waters. No doubt our delinquencies are manyand grave, and the work to be done in all our greattowns sufficiently appalling. To that work weurge attention. But with all our poverty, vice, ignorance,crime, and other evils, there is not any-thingon the earth sanctioned by public law, protectedby public opinion, and smiled on by theteachers of the Christian faith, that for a momentstands parallel with a Virginia slave mart. Hereit is that Jonathan stands without a peer. TheMoloch of Richmond slave-dealing, as being aChristian Moloch, beats all creation.
