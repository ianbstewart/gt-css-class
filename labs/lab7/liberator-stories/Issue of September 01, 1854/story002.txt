 After a very brief speech by the President, (Rev. Prof. of. Airedale College,) in which he maintained thatthe anti-slavery cause was 'founded on the principlesof , of reason, of politics and of religion,and the reading of letters from the Rev. G.W. Conder,of Leeds, who expressed his belief that the time for the of slavery throughout the world had arrived,Dr. Stowell, of Chesham College, advocating the encouragementof Hindoo labor, as opposed to slave labor.R.G. Mdne. of Tintwisle, and Dr. Jenkin, latePresident of Coward College, London,— The Rev. DrBOARD, of Manchester, (who was received with loudcheers,) addressed the audience as follows—(we quotefrom the Manchester Examiner an Times, Aug. 5th):    OARD Examiner an Times Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen I must, in the first place, congratulate my fellow-workmenin this very important cause,on the very successful and happy day that we havehad on this occasion. We have gathered together,on this occasion, some sixty or seventy, more Clergymen and ministers of different defrom various parts of the country.And we have had an opportunity of bearing a teswhich must, I am sure, be felt in everypart of the habitable globe, so distinct and so emhas it been. And yet I judge, Sir, so exwell tempered, and proceeding from quarnames must command respect wherever church prevails. (Hear, hear.) Ilelighted, too, to see so large a meeting thisevening. It is true, that our meetings this morningand this afternoon were rather more powerful numerous, but this meeting this evening is respectable, but highly numerous, and,you will allow me to add, worthy of the city inwhich it takes place. (Cheers.) Sir, the resolutionwhich I am about to submit to the meeting isa  which might with great propriety havebeen presented at the very commencement of our this morning. I am about to ask myfriend and co-operator. Mr. Parkes, to read it toyou. for he has the advantage of having bettereyes than I possess, and the resolution is printedin small type. (Hear.) [Mr. Parkes then readthe resolution, which was as follow]:—             That since a community of sentiments, a communityof principles, and a community of interests, combinewith the great teachings of Christianity to demonstratethat there is but one human family, of which nationsare severally members, and, consequently, to requirefrom every man an earnest, active and practical concernin the well-being of every other, especially ofsuch as suffer any kind of wrong, this Conference deand condemns the persons not being citizens ofthe United States are forbidden to take steps for the removal of the curse of slavery from that Common-wealth.   This resolution recognizes the negro race asbrethren. I take this as my position, and in anyaudience assembled in this city, it is a positionwhich I do not think would be disputed. (Hear,hear) But, inasmuch as we trust that our sayingswill go forth in other parts of the world, itmay be as well to add a remark or two on the point.(Hear, hear). We, then, in this resolution, do that there is an identity of brotherhood asbetween the negro slave in America and ourselves,on  independent grounds. (Hear, hear.)One of these grounds is, that there is a communityof sentiment between them and us. (Hear,hear) I might argue this question of brotheron the general ground of ethnology, or on the of physiology. I might enter into considconnected with the development of the with the descent of families from one common I might take up the biblical statement, thatall men are brothers. in the sense not only thatthey are one species. but that they are the descendantsof one pair—(hear;) and I think I could easily, for I have, in writing, sustained that upon grounds historical, ethnological. physand religious; but I will not do that on There is, however, an evidence uponwhich I think I shall obtain a decided 'Yes' fromevery one present. The resolution I have to proventures to assert that there is a communityof sentiment between the negro and the European—the African and Englishman—Which makesthe two into brothers. (Hear, hear. ) Let me,then, ask this question, whether, when the negromother clasps her child to her bosom, hoping therebynot only to conceal it. but to shelter it againstthe man-stealer, she does not feel identically thesame emotions, the like delicacy, deep, noble, divine,which would be felt under similar circumstancesby the British mother, by the Christianmother, the most highly educated ? (Loud cheers.)Same slight difference, indeed, may be, sir,between the two; but it is a difference of degree,and not a difference of kind. (Hear, hear.) Sir,this is a point upon which I need not to appeal tothe imaginations of the meeting. Sir, I would askyou whether, this very day, we have not had displayedbefore this Conference emotions of the highest.the purest, the noblest kind, which stamp asmen the , dark though their complexion is? Why. how do I know I am in the presencesof men, and addressing human beings ? BecauseI am quite sure that the feelings which I entertain—whether of indignation at oppressionand injury, or whether of delight at the of liberty and truth—are emotions asthey are felt by me so shared by every one of you.(Hear, hear, hear.) So do I know that human beingsare here before me, and that you are everyone identified with me by an identity of nature.Well, then do you not recognize a brother whenthere is presented before you one with negro bloodin his veins who will perhaps make me ashamedfor the feeble utterance I give, by the noble, thenly sentiments of which he shall be the utterer?[  cheers] I say, then, that when the lash deon the negro's back, he feels what I andyou should feel under similar circumstances; andwhen the child is torn away from the negro father's he feels as I and you would feel if our childrenwere carried away into bondage, and to besubjected to stripes. [Hear. hear.] There is, then,an identity of sentiment between us, and, in consequence,the negro is a man, even as I am a man.[Cheers.]                     As to the question of degree, sir, we need notenter into that. It is very possible that the Europeanmay have some faculties superior by endowmentor culture to those of the African, yet theAfrican has his endowments and accomplishments—and I speak from experience, for I have hadthe honor of having them at my table— and I amsure that there beats not a fonder heart, that thereexists not richer emotions, in this city, than are tobe found in the bosoms of the more cultivated andmore elevated of the African race. [Cheers.] Inlogic, they may be surpassed by our Bacons andour Newtons, but in kind, generous, noble, andespecially domestic sentiments, I firmly believethey would carry away the palm from us. [ Hear,hear.] Well, then, if the African is my brother, I wantto know what law there is to prevent my giving expressionto the sentiments of the resolution, or youfrom holding up your hands in  of it? Am I tofeel a sympathy for an African going a bout thestreets of Manchester, and not feel a sympathy foran African going about the streets of New York?[Hear, hear.] No interference with slavery inAmerica? Why, what interference in meant? Theinterference of reason, most undoubtedly; not theinterference of harsh words and misrepresention,most assuredly not, but the interference of soundlogic, sir. Am I to be told that the salve-masteris afraid of that? [Hear, hear.] Will he be afraidof the interference of kind feeling and generousemotion—will any inhabitant of the Britishislands tell me that I am not to have recourse tosuch interference, and will the slave master findfault with that? [Hear, hear.] But I think thatif we were to trace the grounds of complaint aboutinterference, we should find that the reason is, thatthe arguments against slavery make the slavemastersuneasy, make them feel their sin, andplace them before the world in unfavorable colors.Well, then, the interference will at once cease.[Cheers.] But so long as the evil exists, I will, forone, take leave on every fitting occasion to give utteranceto my detestation of slavery in all its relations,and most particularly my hearty detestationagainst slavery as sustained in and by Christianchurches. [Loud cheers.]  Sir, the resolution not only recognizes the Africanas a brother, but it goes further,—it says thatwe ought to extend aid to him; and the reason is,that he is not only a brother, but a suffering brother.Now, it is a very strange thing that, in thenineteenth century, we should have to rise to succorthe needy, and to give a helping hand to theoppressed. Will any one say that he negro inAmerica is not an injured or oppressed man, orwill any one say that a man's own daughter shouldbe carried a way, for the vilest purpose, by force ofarms ? [Hear, hear.] And yet these are thingsthat are taking place hour by hour, and minute byminute, under the daily sun. You would not endurethese things, and, therefore, I am quite sureyou would not hear me for a moment, were Iashamed to give utterance to my abhorrence of theconduct of the oppressor, and the wrongs of theoppressed. [Cheers.] Though cotton may hestrong, good sense and kindred feelings are strongerstill—[hear, hear]—and therefore I do not despair,and the results of our proceedings to-dayshow that we have no reason to despair, but thatthere will be exhibited in this city of ours a veryvivid and practical feeling in behalf of the negro,our suffering brother. [Cheers.] The resolution says farther, that there is also acommunity of interests, as between you and everyother portion of the great family of man. It appearsto me that here again the argument is onlytoo easy; but if I should look for an argument, sir,I should merely point to your ships, which are onevery wave—to your railways, which run not onlyover England, but over Europe, and which unitedifferent parts, the most distant the one from theother; I have only to refer to the electric telegraph,which combines all the families of men intoone huge family; and then I ask you, in additionto this, whether it is possible now, at thistime of the day, with these means of intercourseone with the other,—you sending forth your manufacturesto the remotest ends of the earth, and receivingback the produce of those parts, here receivingcotton, here converting that cotton intocloth, and sending that cloth to foreign shores, andreceiving in exchange their own natural products,—whether it is possible not to discern thatthere is now growing up in the world, and becomingmore and more potent every day, a great communityof interests, which ought to be attended,and will be more and more attended, by a communityof feeling? But, Mr. Chariman, I am desirousof putting this simple representation beforeyou. You say, how are our interests concerned,our own individual interests, in the question ofnegro slavery in the United States? Show us that,if you can? Well, my friends, did you ever knowa nation, in the possession of a very large numberof slaves in its bosom, that was really and trulya nation of freemen ? Sir, you know very well,and any one who has studied human nature knowsvery well, that if there is slavery in a nation,there is something else. The correlative of slaveryis— what? What is the correlative of light ?Darkness. And what is the correlative of slavery?Tyranny. A nation of slaves makes a nation oftyrants; and if the United States has in its soula large tyrannical element,—and I am not sure,sir, that slavery has not done something to brandthem with that curse,—then, I ask you, how areother nations safe ? What, will even England tellme that she is safe from a republic where the commonmind has so much power as it has in America,and where that common mind has, and musthave, received from slavery so deep a brand of tyranny?No, no, my friends, feel assured that ifthere is a dark cloud, and a very heavy cloud,a far-stretching cloud, there in the west, we herein the cost are not free at least from the possibilityof being overshadowed by it. No; the real loverof freedom knows perfectly well that he has aninterest in the prevalence of freedom he looks withalarm sometimes, and always with dislike, at theprevalence of slavery; and those who listened tothe statements that were made to-day have onlytoo much reason to know, that the cloud to which Ihave referred is a very dark cloud is a far-spreadingcloud, and, what is more, it is a very threateningcloud. There is, however, one matter in connection withmy resolution, to which I am desirous of referring,of a more practical nature. I have  vored toset before you the fact that, as there is a communityof sentiment, there ought to be a communityof sympathy in our  towards the negro.Now, Just in proportion as you recognize that communityof sentiment, will you also feel that sympathy;and it is because the community of sentimentis so perfectly acknowledged in this country, aspeciallyon the part of some, to whom I am nowmore particularly about to refer, that this communityof sympathy is no faulty, upon the vigorousprevalence of which we must depend for the greatresources to aid the American slave to  offhis chains. Now, I dare say there are personspresent who hailed, as I did myself, with greatsatisfaction, the coming to the country of the lateGovernor of Hungary, why did I hail his coming among listen with delight is publish to the Why did I rejoices to meet him in private? I did so,because he was a man; I did so, because he wasan oppressed man; I did so, because, therefore, herealized in his history the very description of whatI may term my text. There was more, air, in hisclaim upon our sympathies in Manchester, sir, in hisclaim upon our sympathies in Manchester; he wasnot only an oppressed man, but he was a fugitiveman; and all those who know how hearty the receptionwas that he received in Manchester, haveno doubt watched his career with very deep interact;and will those of them who are present on thisoccasion join with me in lamenting most bitterlythat that man has been recreant to his principles?[hear, hear]—recreant to the very principles whichwon for him so hearty an acclaim in this city? Ihave said, sir, that he was a man; the negro is aman. I have said that he was a suffering man;the negro is a suffering man. I have said that hewas a fugitive man; the negro is often—and wouldthere were more so— a fugitive man. Surely, then,they are in very much the same , andyou would expect Louis Kossuth to have a verydeep and prominent, and all-pervading, sympathywith the cause of the negro, would not you? I amsorry to say that such is not the case. I am herethis evening to tell Louis Kossuth. and I trust thatthe words I utter will reach him, that if he ever expectsto be received in Manchester again with thesame welcome he had when he was a fugitive fromAustrian tyranny, he must be true to his principles.[Cheers.]        A Voice.—What has he done? I will tell you, since my friend there asks it,what he has done. At the beginning of this year,it was intended to hold the meetings, or somethinglike them, which have been hold to-day; and I wasrequested by the committee having the originationof this movement to write to Mazzini. I undertookto write to him, because I had been in correspondencewith Mazzini, and I believe Mazzinihad no reason to regret the liberality of Manchester.I wrote to him, and asked him to come andgive us his support at our meetings, the same wehave held to-day. He was unable to come, but hesent me a letter. That letter is now in my hand;in it he distinctly avows his sympathy in the anti-slaverymovement, the abolition movement in England,of which I stood before him as the representative.And what has Kossuth done? That letterof Mazzini having been transmitted to my friend,Mr. Chesson, the Secretary, was sent by him to thepapers. Mr. Sanders, the representative of theAmerican slave interest in London, grow alarmed,when he saw Mazzini's name given to support theanti-slavery cause, and he wrote to Kossuth, sayingto him, 'Oh, surely, Mazzini does not meanthis, does he? We should be very sorry to find hisname given to the anti-slavery cause.' And thenwhat does Kossuth do, this fugitive, oppressedman? He comes forward and says; 'No, Mazzinidoes not mean it; that letter of his has nothing todo with the anti-slavery movement.' Kossuth doesmore; he attempts to throw discredit on the letterof Mazzini, and says it was an old letter, one withouta date, and Kossuth sends a copy of this statementto America. What has he done? He has,in the first place. (I do not say intentionally,) uttereda simple untruth. I think I can write a letterof application, and make myself understood;I think Mazzini could understand what I wrote;and I think I can understand the reply which hewrote to me. I know what I wrote to him for,—his support of the anti-slavery cause; and I believethat, in the letter Mazzini returned to me,I received that support to the anti-slavery cause,public. Well, now, there are two questions raisedupon this. Is it an anti-slavery letter? That isdisposed of not only, I think, by my own statement,but by the general tenor of the letter itself,which some of you may have seen. But there isanother question, as to the spirit manifested by Kossuthin this matter. Why does Louis Kossuth, ofall men in the world, come forward to take partagainst the slave, and in favor of the slaveholder?Let that question be answered, if it can. Why ishe made a willing instrument in a case thought tobe one of some exigency for the slaveholder? Maxzini'sname is a tower of strength; it was felt thatit would very powerfully appeal to the UnitedStates; and the fact of Mr. Sanders making thatapplication to Louis Kossuth only showed howthe galled jade winced beneath the censure of Maszini'sletter. which contained most admirable andwell-expressed truths. [The letter of Kossuth to Sanders, Mazzini's letterto Dr. Beard, and also the letter addressed by Mazzini,in 1853, to Wm. H. Ashurst, Esq., of London,—thesubstance of which letters is undoubtedly fresh in theminds of all our readers,—were then read to the mting,and]  Dr. BEARD continued: Now. could anything bemore noble than this declaration by Mazzini, on theuniversal truths of human rights and liberty ? Andhow far has Kossuth fallen short of that example?I do not wish to bear bard upon him, but I wanthim to know that, if he expects the support ofManchester, he must be consistent. I have a memory;and I know very well what the state of theliberal feeling in Manchester was when Kossuthcame hither. I know that our leading politiciansand social men were opposed to what was calledintervention; and I know very well, for I heard itwith my own ears, that Kossuth did then advocateintervention on the part of Britain for the sake ofHungary, and that he asserted the general principleof intervention. Our breasts were steeledagainst such an appeal at that time, and in sympathizingwith him as a persecuted man, we did,Idid myself, rather restrain our principles with regardto intervention, that we might receive Kossuthto our hearts. Then, if Kossuth was for an interferenceon behalf of Hungary, I want to know whatinconsistency with his principles there would be,if he interfered a little now on behalf of the oppressednegro? (Cheers.) And I think I know something,from the experience of nearly thirty years,of the predominant state of feeling in the politicaland social world of Manchester, at least in the radicalportion of Manchester society; and I do believeit recognizes the love of liberty, as liberty, allover the world,—not for England only. not for Europeonly, but for man as man; and if, before thisaudience, I could new put a few questions to thegreat leaders in Manebester,—men to when allhonor is due, and to whom not only Manebesterand Lancashire, but the whole country, is indebtedfor the real promotion of civil and religious liberty,—each of those men would say to you for himself,as I say for myself now, 'I love liberty in England,because I love liberty im Austria, in Hungary, inItaly—liberty in Europe, and liberty in the UnitedStates an everywhere,' (Cheers.) I am glad tosee my old friend, Mr. Dyer, present here, the  of what I may term the formest radicalsection of our liberal politicians. He will hearwitness that I have truly, however imperfectly,represented the feelings of Manchester. EARD   After some other ch Dr. Sord wenton to say: I deeply regress that it how fellow to myduty to go against are with whom, at are time, Iwent tent if he put forth in the cause of Hungary. (Cheers).    The Rev. W.PARKER the resolution, andit was carried unanimously. ARKER The PRESIDENT then called upon Mr, ParkerPillsbury, who was about to address the meeting,when RESIDENT Mr. George Thompson said he would obtrudeupon the notice of the meeting for a moment, inorder that they might not be strangers to the pasthistory of his friend who was about to addressthem. He was an American abolitionist, of theradical or ultra school—(cheers)—and he was aworking abolitionist—a man who had devoted thelast thirteen of fourteen tears of his life to thecause of the oppressed bondman. He would be ableto tell them, if his modesty would allow him, ofthe toils he had gone through, and the success hehad achieved; but if he did not, he (Mr. Thompson)hoped an occasion would come when some onewho knew and loved him would give them some ideaof the life of the abolitionist in America, by pointingto the labors of Parker Pillsbury. He camehere with the beat love and most profound commendationof the abolitionists of the advocates of abolitionthere. For sincerity he was excelled by none,for abundance of labors he had scarcely an equal.If there ever was an advocate of the slave, in anypart of the world, who deserved at the hands ofany audience a warm welcome, Parker Pillsburydemanded it to-night at the hands of a liberty-lovingManchester audience. (Loud cheers.) Mr. Parker Pillsbury. of the United States,then rose, and was received with great enthusiasm.He-said: I am very sorry that I shall have to disappointthis audience to-night, if they suppose it possiblethat I can justify the encomiums which have beenbestowed upon me. However, I am consoled withthe reflection, that I would, were it in my power,not only justify all that has been said, but evenexceed it; for the subject on which I am to speakis one that, I am sure, might well engage the attentionand utmost ability of the loftiest seraphthat bows before the Eternal throne. I am not anAmerican citizen, for the reason that I would notbe voluntarily recognized as properly associated witha crew of pirates. I am one of the disfranchisedAmericans; and, however I may have been educatedunder democratic influences, and however myparentage, for two centuries back, has breathed theair of New England— and however my ancestrywere among the first who omigrated from thiscountry—and however I still posses a love forevery republican principle—(hear, hear,)—yet, inorder that I might remember those who were inbonds as bound with them, I have voluntarily disfranchisedmyself and only live in my own countrya stranger and a foreigner there. (Cheers.)For the pries of citizenship, in the United Statesof America, is too high for me to pay. (Hear.)Much as I love American citizenship—glad as Ishould be to participate in the affairs of government—willing as I should be, not only to vote, but, possibly,like some others of my countrymen, to bevoted for—yet, for the sake of the slave, I have notbeen to the polls for the last ten or twelve years;and, until our country shall have dissevered itselffrom the vilest system of oppression that ever sawthe sun, I will stand outside of the government,and demand its overthrow, in the name of justiceand in accordance with the principles of the administrationof the Most High. (Cheers.) Sir, I would that I could stand before you, assome of your fellow-subjects have stood before audiencesin America, boasting that they came froma land of liberty. I come from no such land. Iknow it is our boast, and has been now for morethan three-quarters of a century, that we are free.I Know it was laid down by the American government,at the time of its formation, that 'all menare created equal, and endowed by the Creator withthe inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuitof happiness. I know that on every 4th Julysince 1776, our country has echoed and re-echoedthat sentiment from the Atlantic to the Alleghenies,and across the Aheghanies to the Father ofWaters in the West; but yet, Mr. Chairman, althoughit was uttered in 1776, and has been re-affirmedfrom that day down to the present time,yetit was a lie in the beginning, as we embraced it;and it has been a lie adhered to from that day downto the present. (Hear, hear.) Notwithstandingwe claim that all men are created equal, we havere-created a sixth part of God's freely-created creatures,base chattered slaves, under the Constitutionand laws of our country. We have now existedmore than three-quarters of a century as a nation:we began by asserting the doctrine that all men arecreated free and equal: we began by stating to theworld our grievances, as inflicted by the governmentof Great Britain; we threw off the Britishyoke, and established what was then called, andwhat has over since been called, a free and republicangovernment; but in the formation of the Constitution,we laid the foundation for a system ofslavery, which has cursed our country, and cursed. ever since, It has often been said, Iknow, that slavery was entailed upon us by GreatBritain. I know that slavery was there while wewere yet under the government of Great Britain.I know this, however,—that we threw off many ofthe rigorous demands and exactions of the Britishgovernment; many of those evils which we supposedevils, and which had been on tailed upon us,we threw off; but slavery did not happen to beone of those evils of which we took care so soon torid ourselves; yet it has been our boast, formthat day to this, that your British government,that your George III. with his parliament, entailedthe slave system upon our country. (Hear.)We have had time, however. Mr. Chairman, tothrow it off, had we been so disposed; but, unfortunatelyfor us, and still more unfortunately for itunhappy . we have not yet over thrown thatsystem. On the contrary, it is not too much tosay, that  for the last twenty-five years,the grand and ing subject of the Americangovernment has been the extension and perpetrationof that same slave system which you haveas often been told was  upon us by the governmentof your country.      New Mr. Chairman, those are several mistakenwhich I would correct if I had time, and I will runover a few of them as fast as I possibly can. Oneof them is that we are, as we ago so ofter representedto be, a free and democratic government. I we  our government seventy-five yearsago. At that  we went  slaves fromAfrica: the  with all its ,was them well-known i the American people, andone of the first things done by the American governmentwas to  to the States of theSouth the  by of the government,— did than, that into import a sufficientnumber of slaves from Africa to people theslave States, and to prevent say  thatmight arise afterward from a lack of that kind ofmarketable commodity. And on, for twenty yearsthe African slave trade was continued, the governmentof the country being absolutely prohibited bythe Constitution itself —the fundamental law—frominterfering in any way whatever with that traffic.And even then, the Constitution did not say theslave trade should cease at the end of twenty years;it only forbade the government to interferes with itin that time; and although it has since been abolishedby the statute law, there is at the presenttime a determination on the part of the people tore-establish that traffic, in order to people the immensenew territories, which, by the passage of theNebraska bill, the Mexican war, and the Mexicanpurchases, have been added to our country.               Another mistake, Mr. Chairman, is this: thatthe slave population of our country are black, andthat they are Africans, It is not so. Whoeverhas travelled in the Southern States, will have beenstruck, perhaps, with the fact that slavery is mostaggressive in its demands on its marriage and socialjoys, and everything that renders life a blessing, itis a absolutely robbing the African of his color andnative complexion. You would be astonished, Mr.Chairman, in travelling in the Southern States, tosee how fast, — even hot and sultry as that climateis,—how fast the African complexion is bleachingout. Our newspapers are full of advertisementslike this I hold in my hand, from the TuscaBeacon, in the State of Alabama— an advertisementfor a runaway slave:— TuscaBeacon  'Run a way, from the subscriber, a woman namedFanny, who is about twenty years old, father tall, canread and write, and so can forge a pass for herself, Shecarried with her a pair of ear-rings and a Bible with ared cover; she is very pious, prays a great deal, andwas supposed to be contented and happy, She is aswhite as most white women are– with straight, lighthair, and blue eyes, and can pass anywhere for a whitewoman. I will give five hundred dollars for her apprehensionand delivery, so that I cover her.'  It is signed, 'Joseph Balch,' dated Tuscaloosa,May 29th, and is taken from the Alabama Beacon,of the 14th June following. New, Mr. Chairman,it is true that the African complexion is fast disappearing.I cannot tell you the process. Theabominations of slavery are not fit to be named.(Hear, hear.) I could not tell you the secrets ofthe slave's prison, or I should Alabama Beacon 'A tale unfold, whose lightest wordWould harrow up your souls, freeze up your blood,And make each particular hair to stand on end,Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.'    So it is. In the States of Virginia, Maryland,Kentucky, and some others, the business is not thegrowth of cattle and sheep, as among the farmersof your country, but the business is the growth ofhuman beings for the more Southern of our salveStates. A large number of women are kept, andsmall numbers of men, and the proportion is mostappalling; and, what is more revolting still, thereis. in almost every planter's in almost every slavegrower'sfamily, the fullest assurance, that thechildren that are born in his own house, and thechildren that are born in his slave cabins, owe theirexistence to the same paternity. A few years ago,the general assembly of the Presbyterian Church,in their seal to promote the practice of infant baptism,passed an ordinance, that not only shouldparents bring their children to the altar for baptism,but they went so far as to say, that planters andslaveholders should bring their infant slaves, andhave them also baptized on the faith of their masters.It was an awful satire; but, Mr. Chairman,it was undoubtedly very often true that they werebaptized not only on the faith of the master, buton the faith of the father, too. So that, I say,slavery is not now confined to the African complexion,but, on the contrary, it is very fast robbing theAfrican of his complexion; and let me tell youthis, for I may declare so much that the whiterthe slave, if the slave be a female, the higherprice she command in the market: and that iswhy this man offers 500 dollars for the recovery ofa single slave. I wish I had time, and I would like to bring beforethis audience some facts in relation to the saleof a few white slaves, whose affecting whose mostafflicting cases have come before the Americanpublic. Poor Emily Russell was advertised in ournational capital two years since,—in the city ofWashington, while the Congress of the UnitedStates was in session, while the President was anoccupant of the White House there, ready to signwhatever bill or  the Congress might enact.Emily Russell, a young slave of only nineteen yearsof age, was advertised by her owners, and was declaredto be, I know not but with the strictest truth,she was declared to be. and acknowledged, themost beautiful woman in all that part of the country.While she was advertised before the saletook place, an offer was  to ransom her, thatshe might be restored . Her mother livedin the State of New  Her mother made themost vigorous , and caused a letter to be addressedto her owners demanding to know the price.In the most insolent manner possible—to show youhow slavery can thus trifle with the tenderest affectionsof our common nature, in the most insolentmanner possible—they wrote to that heart-brokenwoman; 'We will sell your daughter to any Southerngentleman who wishes to purchase her for 1,800dollars; but if the Northern abolitionists want tobuy her, our price is 2,100 dollars to them.' Suchwas the answer that mother obtained to her requestthat her daughter might not be sold till the moneywas raised for has , and also to know howmuch money it would require to accomplish thatransom. Before $2,1000 were raised, the 'Southerngentleman' appeared, and bought Emily Russell, andset off with her to his  in New Orleans.She had previously written a letter to her mother,of the most affecting character—for she was able write.She says: 'Oh, dear, dear mother? I amsoon to be sold; and, if I am sold, oh, mother ?you know what my fate must be,' She was sold;but, on her  to New , the God ofcompassion had pity on her, and snatched her fromthe laws of the destroyer, and placed her, I doubtnot a beautiful jewel in his own merciful bosses.(Loud applauses.) She died of a broken heart, butwent, I trust, to that land where the wicked indeedcases from troubling and the weary are for over atrest. (Continued applause.) Such,Mr. Chairman,is the slave system of our country, such itshave upon human affections. I was speaking ofthe progress our government had made, —I said ithad prohibited the African slave —I cold thebad prohibited the African slave : and it hasmade it a capital . By the laws of our country,an African slave under is to be being as a pirate;but I must also say, Mr. Chairman, thatalthough that law has now less in existence to of a country, and  although it hascountry every year, and, thought a number of Americanslavers have been to our parts, yet the we have counted men for various crime, thoughwe have hunted and punished men for befriendinga fugitive slave, we have never yet  any manfor the crime of making it his  to bringslaves from Africa. Several have been tried andpardoned. I wish you to see, Mr Chairman, thatour morality in America is a morality of latitudeand . It does not matter what the crimeis, but it matters very materially where the crimeis committed. If I go to Africa to import slaves,I am to be hung in the United States as a pirate,— though I should be in likely to be hang for makingthis address to you is —(hear,hear);but, then, by the laws of the country. I should behung as a pirate. But, if I wished to be Presidentof the United States,—to be chief magistrate ofour nation,—the first thing I should do would be togo into one of our slave-breeding States, and carryon the business of raising slaves, supplying, by thedomestic slave trade, the foreign market. We havescarcely had a President for the last twenty-fiveyears, who was selected for ant other reason underheaven but his connection with the slave system ofthe country, by being a holder or a breader ofslaves. and generally both. Now look at it. JamesK. Polk, for instance, one of our late Presidents,grew rich, mainly by raising slaves in for the Louisiana market, and never would havebeen President, Mr. Chairman, but for his connectionwith the slave system: for, although he wasa man of very small ability, he had ability enoughto know he was not fit to he President, and honestyenough to say so; but still he was connected withslavery,a breeder of slaves, and grew rich by thatbusiness, and thereby became eligible to the highestoffice in my nation's gift. My friend. Mr.Thompson, has put into my hands a list of thePresidents of the United States. I am sorryto begin the list with George Washington. GeorgeWashington was our first President. He foughtbravely and heroically for his own liberty againstthe tyranny of this country. as it was called, wadedeight years in blood to achieve his own liberty,and then went home, and to the day of his death,drove hundreds of his follow-men to unpaid andunpitied toil. I am sorry to make the announcement,but, when I speak at all, God helping me,I must speak the truth. (Cheers.) I am glad tosay this, however,—Washington, when he died,emancipated his slaves. (Hear, hear,) Washingtonwas a slaveholder. John Adams, of Massachusetts,was not a slaveholder. (Cheers.) ThomasJefferson was a Virginia slaveholder; James Madisonwas a Virginia slaveholder; James Muwas a Virginia slaveholder; John Quincy Adamswas not a slaveholder—(cheers.) but, to his creditbe it spoken, was threatened with  byslaveholders in the halls of Congress, and the wonderwas that he did not fall there, pierced withmore wounds then fell on  in Rome, GeneralJackson was a  from Martin Van Buren was of New York: and the Southsaid,—and for once I honor the South for telling thetruth,—the South said, that although he was aNorthern man, be was a Northern man with Southernprinciples. He demonstrated the truth moststrikingly of what they said of him in the South, bydeclaring to the country, in one of his official proclamations,that he would veto any bill that might passour Congress demanding the abolition of slavery,oven in the national capital. Then came Gen. Harrison:he was a Northern man, and, as was thought,a man of Southern principles; my own opinionis, that he was a Northern man, but without anyprinciples whatever. (Cheers.) The next Presidentmentioned here was accidentally President, andsucceeded General Harrison, and that was JohnTyler. John Tyler was a slaveholder of Virginia.Probably there are quite a large number of thisaudience who remember the protest against Americanslavery issued by the Duchess of Sutherland,two or three years since, and the lady of this JohnTyler was selected to reply to it. This lady was adamsel of about twenty years old, and John Tylerwas about inveigled into this alliance; and they putit on her as a sort of degradation,—as it seemed tobe a sort of assurance that by coming to the Southshe had become a Southern.—to attempt a reply tothe document that  from Stafford House, andit came to this country signed by the wife of Ex-PresidentTyler. I think it never made much noisein your country. I am sure it made very little inmine. (Hear, hear.) The next was James. K.Polk, who grew rich by breeding slaves in Tennessee,and then came Zachary Taylor. The Whigparty of our county, opposing the  partyin the  of Texas and the Mexicanwar, it seems to me, almost corrupted the Englishlanguage, by investing new courses with which toload the Mexican  for God  that Iever call it a war—the Mexican  —when100,000 Mexicans were put to death by my countrymen,that they might seize their land and propertyfor the purposes of . This GeneralTaylor was a whig, and was selected by thewhigs as their candidate for the Presidency,after they had sat up nights, for at least fouryears, one might think, to invent new curses withwhich to load the war, out of which he had reapedhis harvest of laurels that availed to make him thechief magistrate of his country. He died, too—andit has been said by a waggish friend of mine, whenthe whig party got a candidate who succeeded, healmost immediately died—whilst the unsuccessfulcandidates were not only very numerous, but apparentlyimmortal. (Laughter.) General Taylordied, and then  whowas President when the fugitive slave law was on acted,which was now in full force, and had beenrecently executed in Boston, under circumstancesI am sure which would best do honor to any reignof terror recorded in the pages of history. (Hear.)The present of the office is General Pierce,a Northern democrat, but a Northern man withSouthern principles, in so far as he has any principlesat all. (Laughter.) Now, Washington, andJefferson, and Madison, Mu, and Jackson, andTaylor, and Polk, and Taylor, eight of them, had allbeen Slaveholders: The remainder were Northernmen— with the  of the —withSouthern principles; and another fast worthy ofnote is, that the slaveholders have been re-elected,and have filled the office a second term, whilst neverin a single instance, has a Northern man beencounted worthy to ill the office but four years;ad since the existence of our government, theSouthern slaveholders have had the Presidency for48 years, while the Northern men had had the officeonly 16 years. (Hear, hear.) And yet thepopular vote of the North is twise as large as thepopular vote of the South; the free population ofthe North is twise as large as the free populationof te South: and the revenue of the country ispaid of the  of ten dollars from the North tothese  from the South.I mention these things, because they go to showyou how slavery contrives to control the interestsof our country. No man is ever selected for thePresidency until he has been tried on the subjectof slavery—until he has been weighed in their un-righteousbelace—whether he is ready and willingto bow low enough; and then, once in abtwelve or sixten years, they consent to give a Northernman the Presidency. (Hear, hear.) And behindthis disproportion they have contrived, foryou may not be aware of it, to retain the entirepower of government in their own hands: forthough you are a Monarchy, and we a Democracy.the President has more power in his little fingerthan Her Majesty and all her cabinet have. (Applause.)Yes, and he has not a single ounce ofpower which he is not required to use on behalf ofery, and pledged to use beforehand. Take our1st presidential election as an illustration. Gen.Prce of New  was elected. He wasa near  of mine. and I do not know whetherl should have been any more surprised had mygardener been nominated, than I was at the nominationof General Pierce, and I am quite sure thatmy gardener was the honester man, and I shouldprefer to give him my vote for the Presidency. Hewas, however, selected. General Cass, of the Democraticparty, and same others of a similar character,who had exerted themselves to the utmostto procure the enactment of the Fugitive SlaveLaw. were doing it for Southern votes, as Websterand clay, of the Whig party, had done the same.Now, the policy of the slaveholding States is toget these influential men to aid in the performanceof all such infamous work as the enactment ofthe Fugitive Slave Law, the annexation of Texas,the Mexican massacre, and all that. Our Northernpoliticians are green enough to suppose afterthey have stooped and done the slaveholders' filthiestwork, that then the slaveholders will takethem for Presidents of the United States. Theyalways find out their mistake, however, and neitherWebster, nor Clay, nor Case, nor any of thesemen, were thought worthy of the nomination to thePresidency. But they went into the obscure Stateof New Hampshire, and selected General Pierce,for the very reason that nobody knew anything badof him—because nobody knew anything of him atall—(laughter)—and they pledged him in the mostsolemn manner to the work of executing the FugitiveSlave Law in particular; and, when they hadsolemnly pledged him to that work, then they madehim a candidate for that high office. (Laughter.)Now, we had read 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' for morethan eighteen months. and our nation had shedmore tears over 'poor Tom' than over Washingtonor any other President who had died since. (Applause.)From one end of the country to the otherthere was nothing but weeping and wailing, andour nation became, as in the Hebrew history,'Bokim,' a place of weeping, because 'Uncle Tom'had died miserably in the cabin of 'Simon Legree.''Uncle Tom' was dramatized, and carried into ourtheaters; it was played 100 nights in Boston; ithad been played over 160 nights in one theatre inNew York, besides for months in two or three others;and after this weeping over that tale of sorrow,and after cursing slavery with all the sympathyof our inmost souls, General Pierce, pledgedsolemnly to the execution of that law, but notto the execution of any other on the Americanstatute, received at the end of eighteen monthsthe largest vote ever given to any President.That is the character of the American People inreference to this subject.                                                  I will tell you to what the Democratic partypledged themselves, and to what their candidatewas pledged. The Fugitive Slave Law must be familiarto most before me: the Democratic candidatewas pledged to this—that he would resist allattempts to repeal the Fugitive Slave Law; thathe would exert his utmost influence to prevent allfurther agitation of the subject; and the partyplatform required him to discountenance all agitationon the subject of slavery, whenever, wherever,and however it should exist. But I must not detain this audience. There areothers who have a better this claim upon your attentionthan I can possibly have. [' No.' and applause.]I have simply shown how our governmentcontrives to maintain slavery; I have shownthat slavery is not now confined to the African race,and that in the present order of things in ourcountry, the African complexion may disappear.while slavery itself shall continue to grow strongerand stronger. Now, there is a voice that theEnglish people can lift up that will be heard. Ihave alluded to the remonstrance that came fromStafford House, and that single appeal,—no matterwhat may have been said or felt in regard to ithere,—that single appeal had more effect on theAmerican conscience and American feelings, andhad really more effect on the American nation, thanall the state documents of all the monarchs ofEngland since the reign of George the Third.('Hear, hear,' applause,) And all I wish is,that you would continue to utter these protests. Letevery church utter its protest; let every town andvillage utter its protest throughout the kingdom;and I tell you that that voice, however feeble itmay sound here, will go thundering along the Alleghenymountains, and will reach he caverns wherethree millions of our countrymen lie bound andbleeding in the very midnight of despair. [Hear.]I tell you that our country, though it professes tobe free, and to have proclaimed itself independentof Great Britain, is at this moment at your feet inthis matter; and never had the monarchs of England,prior to our revolution, such power over theAmerican people as you have to-day, if you willbut exercise it. And, Mr. Chairman, I leave thatsubject for your consideration. I hope from thiscountry. during the present year, there will be asuccession of protests and remonstrances that shallstrike as the force of the earthquake, and go throughthe slaves' prisons in the South. [Great applause.] Mr. W.W. BROWN, a fugitive slave, next addressedthe meeting. He said: ROWN Mr. Chairman, and ladies and gentlemen, I wouldmuch have preferred that my friend Mr. Pillsburyshould have occupied the time that is intended formyself. As has been said, he is not only thoroughlyacquainted with the workings of slavery in theUnited States, but he is one of our oldest and bestpioneers. He has had the advantage of early education,he has the advantage of me at the presenttime, and I feel confident could not only claim yourattention, but could give you better information in abetter manner than I could possibly hope to do. Istand here to-night without ever having had a day'sschooling in my life. You have been called togetherto hear men speak to-night—I am here as apiece of property. I am a slave according to thelaws of the United States. Something has beensaid this afternoon about my having been purchasedby the liberality of the English people; I knownot that such a purchase has taken place; I knowit is in contemplation and many suppose it mayhave been accomplished by this time, but I do notknow that such is the case. I stand here, thisevening, therefore, not only a slave, a piece of propertyaccording to the laws of the United States,but I am here without education or without havingreceived a day's schooling in my life, and whata location I have, has been of my own seeking in mymy own way; and therefore, I can hope to say butlittle that shall go to aid in making up the testimonythat is intended by the holding of this conference.(Applause.) No one can read, Mr.Chairman, the declaration of the American independence,and compare that document with thehistory of the legislation of the federal governmentof the United States, without being struck with themarked inconsistency of the theory of the peopleand their acts; the one declaring that all men arecreated equal, and endowed by their Creator withcertain inalienable rights, among which are life,liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and the otheris the history of the encroachment of slaveryupon liberty, or legislation in favor of slavery inthat country against the cause of freedom. Fromthe very hour that the convention was held to formthe Constitution of the United States down to thepresent time. the acts of the government have beenfor the perpetuation and the spread of slavery inthat land. As has been said, slavery was introducedinto the Constitution by allowing the Africanslave trade to be continued for twenty years, makingit lawful and constitutional, which it had neverbeen before; and then the slave-owner was allowedrepresentation for this slave property, andevery man that would go to the coast of Africa.and steal five Negroes and bring them to the UnitedStates, was allowed by the Constitution, then, threevotes for the five slaves. And it is carried down tothe present time, as the American Congress hasmore than twenty-five representatives based uponthis slave representation. And that is one of thereasons why in the national Congress the ershave the power of carrying so many of theirmeasures, and the twenty-five, I need not say, whoare slave-owners themselves, do not represent, butmisrepresent their 'property', and those slave-ownersgo for the purpose of spreading the system ofslavery over the land.  America is called a free and independent country,and yet there is not a single foot of soil overwhich the stars and the stripes ware upon whichI could stand and be protected by law. (tion.)There is not a foot of soil in the UnitedStates upon which I could stand where the Constitutionwould give me any protection; and let mereturn to the United States, I am liable to be at any moment, and conveyed in chains to theSouthern States, there handed over to a manwho claims me as his property, and to be workedup as be may think fit. Such is true as regardseven the early history of slavery. It is true thatCongress, under the U.S. Constitution. agreed toabolish the foreign slave trade in twenty years,but the internal slave trade is carried on, and Iaver that it is even worse—sotting aside the middlepassage—than anything connected with the foreignslave trade. In the old States, slaves are raised forthe market; they have their family attachments,and they are probably, to some extent, more enlightened,and not so much degraded by heathas the negroes upon the coast of Africa; and,as men become more enlightened, the separation offamilies, and the buying and selling of them toslavery, is so much the worse. They feel it themore, and therefore I think that when we look andsee that 100,000 slaves are annually taken fromthe slave-raising States, to supply the Southernmarkets— the cotton, sugar, and rice plantationsof the far South— we must be satisfied that the internaltrade that is carried on by the people of theUnited States is as grievous in its effect as theAfrican slave trade when carried on by the peopleof that country.    I know that some suppose that the evils of slaveryare exaggerated. I have been asked again andagain if certain portions of. Uncle Tom's Cabin'were not exaggerations. Of the working of slavery,in my opinion, I don't think anything can exaggeratethat infamous system. When we look andsee that there are at the present time enslaved betweenthree and four millions of God's children,who are put upon the auction stand and sold tothe highest bidder, no language which we can usecan exaggerate the workings or the evils of the systemof slavery as is carried on in that country.(Applause.) The fugitive slave law, that by manypeople here is considered a great evil, is at presentthe Law in America, and it is the most atrociouslaw ever concocted by the human brain or humanlegislation—a law that sets every other statute inthe shade when we look at the barbarous provisionsthat it contains. By the fugitive slave law.every colored man in that country is liable to bearrested and carried off to the far South, and madea slave of, no matter whether born in New York,Massachusetts, Vermont, or any free State. Thegate of separation which has hitherto kept the inhabitantsof the Northern States from participatingin slaveholding, is now thrown down: andevery man who wishes to go into the slaveholdingbusiness, has now only to find some one who shallparticipate in the gain, and to aware that the coloredperson whom he means to enslave, is the propertyof that man whom he has brought forwardfor that purpose, and so the poor colored man iscarried a way to the South. In the State of Illinois,during the past few months, a colored man was arrestedunder the fugitive slave law, who had livedin the same town some fifteen years, and had byhis industry accumulated 1,500 or 2,000 dollarsworth of property: and the man who came uponthis man, and claimed and seized him as a slave,was not only a professing Christian, but was aminister of the gospel, and one who belongs to thesame denomination as the man whom he claimedfor his property. It was in vain this colored manasserted that he was a free man, and had a right tobe free; that no one had any right to take himaway; that he was free born, and from the State ofOhio. The only respite he could obtain was, thathe was allowed, as a favor, to go to prison, and tostay there for a while, until he could get hisproperty and other affairs in the place disposed of;and in the meantime he was obliged to find security,and to pay an officer three dollars a day to watch himand see that he did not run a way. He agreed tothis. but after a while he ha had collected evidence bywhich he proved himself to be free, and was enabledto demand his release. But a debt had beenaccumulated during his detention, to the amount of$3,000, so that. although he had thus escaped beingsent into slavery, he was utterly ruined. Thisis the history of a free colored man in the State ofIllinois. There is a more atrocious case I can tellyou. Within the last year. two villains from aSouthern State arrived in a certain town of Pennsylvania,and attempted to seize a colored man,who was employed there as a waiter in one of theinns. They approached him in a clandestine manner,and threw their chains upon his limbs; butthe man, whom they would have made a slave, escapedfrom his pursuers; he ran out of the house,he ran to the nearest stream, and plunged into it,and there stood at bay. immersed up to his neck inthe running waters. The slave-hunters came up,and many people gathered around, sympathizingwith the hunted fugitive. He exclaimed to his persecutors,If any of you come near me here, Iwill drown him in this water that flows about me.The slave-hunters answered him, 'If you don'tcome out of the river, and surrender, we will shootyou where you are.' And then, suddenly, to thehorror and astonishment of all the bystanders, oneof the slave-hunters raised his gun or pistol, aimedit at the fugitive, and fired at him. We are toldhow the water then ran red with the blood of theslave; and how a crowd of four or five hundredpeople, who stood by and saw this thing done, didnothing more than cry 'Shame' upon those whohad done it, because it was the law. Sir I do feelconfident, that if in this country such a law existed,and if any two persons came into a town of England,and dared openly to ill-treat a human beingin that way, there would not be three or four hundredEnglishmen standing by so dead to the feelingsof humanity as to let such a thing be done intheir presence, and content themselves with crying'Shame!' I feel certain, that, in England, thevillains who should do such an outrage would instantlybe compelled to fly the spot. (Cheers.)  Mr. PILLSBURY: My friend will allow me to interrupthis narrative with the addition of one ortwo circumstances which he has forgotten to mention.While that poor fellow stood up to his neckin water, they fired three rifle balls at him. two ofwhich took effect upon him, and dyed the river withhis blood. He escaped across the river, however,but fainted and fell from the wounds he had received,the moment he reached the opposite shore.Some of his friends assisted him, and he was delivered;but those  who shot him were arrestedand tried,  acquitted of havingcommitted any  is what they had done. ILLSBURY    Mr. WELIS BROWN [continued]: Well, now,you will recollect that all this was perpetrated inthe State of Pennsylvania, in one of those whichare called the free States. We hear people speakof free and slave States; but I hold that thereis no such distinction; for now there are nofree States in the United States of America. Thereare none of them free, because that cannot befree State which cannot protect the freedom of itsinhabitants; and there is no State in the Unionnow which can give liberty, or even secure his liberty,to the colored man. His rights are nothing.if the slaveholder pursues him. The courts ofjustice in some of those 'free States' have beenconverted into prisons, in which the fugitive slavesof the Southerners have been kept for them; andvery recently, in Boston, a slave was arrested, andconfined for six or seven days in the court-housewhich was guarded by muskets and cannon to preventhis rescue; thence he was put on board a vesselin the harbor, and carried away to the far South,to a life of slavery. The boast of the free States.that people there enjoy perfect freedom, is most untrue:for under the Fugitive Slave Law, the slave ownersof the South are empowered to enter 'free States,' and employ not only the marshals ofthe Union, in arresting any of the colored peoplewhom they choose to claim, but compel the inhabitantsof the place, under severs penalties, to the effect of this Fugitive Slave Law, and, indeedof every thing else that is connected with slaveryin the United States. If you had been, as I havebeen, for twenty years of your life in the SouthernsStates of America, and had seen there, as I seen, the workings of slavery, the trading in humanbeings, the buying and selling of them, whipping and abusing of them, as I have seen that carried on there,—and if you had seen dear  from you, and  to be the auctionbidder, as I have seen my to see them could net think any thing, in the at this have read, was at all know you roud, and with history of the member that go to the United States, and as cruel as were ever down age, are done in America now,the Southern States, and the Northern States: you who sit on the vor of slavery, and who know, too. that the tence orders thus to be the Southern States, will be It was asserted not long odore Parker, that ons of been seized in the North and very, had been flogged to death, or and such will be the  of many of them, Them,ought not facts like those to be known throughoutthe country? ELIS ROWN                                    I am glad these meetings are held, and that thisAssociation has been formed. I hope is will dosomething to instruct the people here, and to maintainanti-slavery principles, so that Englishmen,when they visit the United States, may not dohenceforth, as many of their countrymen havedone, give their influence to the side of the oppressor,instead of the oppressed. (Cheers.) That isnow most important to the , for thousands ofpersons, emigrants and others, are going to theUnited States every year, and they ought to understandthe matter. If nothing else could be accomplished,yet meetings like those and lecturingwould be worthy objects of the efforts of this Association.It is true, there is already in Englandan Anti-Slavery Society established. But I mustsay, and with great respect for the excellent personswho belong to it, that that Society is so inactive,it scarcely does any thing throughout theyear but hold an anniversary meeting: and it is afact, sir, that speeches like those which were madein the Conference to-day, or to-night upon this platform,would not be tolerated on the platform of theBritish and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in London.(Cheers.) It may be said of us, that wehave used very strong language. why, sir, hasnot the time come for strong language ? Thosewho want milk and water, let them go to Londonat anniversary time, and they will get it there, inhomœopathic doses. (A laugh.) Probably, thefact of my having once been a slave, and of myfeeling upon this subject so intensely, having relationsof my own still dragging out the life of slavery,has made me feel, that something strong shouldbe uttered. (Cheers.) People want somethingstrong— they are willing to hear it; then I say,why not give it them ? There is need, I think, of anassociation in this country, which shall expose tothe British nation the working of slavery in America,and the fact as it is; which shall give a truerepresentation also, and not merely a partial account,of what the abolitionists in America aredoing. [Cheers.] I am identified, as you maywell believe, with the most ultra of the abolitionists,who are, I consider, speaking the truth moreeffectually than any other party or association inthe United States; and I consider also, that thegreatest of the champions of human liberty thereis the present leader of the anti-slavery movementin the United States—WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON.[Great cheering.] I know there are some whowould be a fraid to utter that sentiment, becausethey would be afraid of losing caste. I, sir, havenothing to lose, but everything to gain. [Cheers.]  ILLIAM LOYD ARRISON. I have now been five years in this country. Ihave travelled through Great Britain, and am almostan Englishman: I think I know something ofthe public sentiment here; and I say, the peoplewant to know the truth, and to know what theycan do for us. I tell them, that those ultra abolitionistsof America, to whom I have referred, arethose who in America are considered to be thegreatest foes of the Fugitive Slave Law, and of allthe acts of the pro-slavery party; those are thepersons of whom slaveholders speak with mostmalignity, and who are more vilified by the Americanpro-slavery press than all other parties andassociations put together. This may be, unless Ican comply with an invitation to speak on Thursday,(and I am afraid that I cannot do so,) my lastopportunity of speaking publicly in this country;but I shall return to the United States, after beingfive years in England, conscious that I may safelygive to the free colored people of the North, andto the abolitionists of the United States, the assurancethat something is being done here for theircause, and that the English people only want toknow what they can do, and they will set about itand do it. [Cheers.] We do not ask you to takeup arms; we do not ask you to do any act, or utterany language, unbecoming Christians: but we askyou to learn the facts and the truth of this matter,and honestly and strongly to speak out uponit. [Mr. Brown sat down amidst hearty cheers.] those The CHAIRMAN said he was sorry to hear such anaccount given of the meetings of the British andForeign Anti-Slavery Society. He did not knowhow far it might be correct, but he knew that Societywas doing a great deal of good by its publications.He paid a compliment to its organ, theAnti-Slavery Reporter.as now conducted. HAIRMAN Anti-Slavery Reporter. Mr. GEORGE THOMPSON rose amidst much cheering.and said that he had been requested to giveto the meeting some information respecting theproceedings of the conference, which had held twositting during the day, and had adopted a seriesof most important anti-slavery resolutions. Heconcluded his remarks as follows: — EORGE HOMPSON It would have been injustice, while consideringthe subject of American slavery, to have overlookedthe claims of the American Anti-Slavery Society.That society was formed in 1833, on the return ofMr. Garrison from his first mission to this country.Its principles were of the most lofty, uncompromising,and Christian character, and its spirit as catholicand unsectarian as the object for which thesociety was instituted. For twenty-one years ithad pursued a career of undeviating consistency.There was no time to dwell upon the history ofthis society. but the results of its labors were seenin the present state of public opinion in the freeStates. The conference finally directed attentionto the various methods by which individuals mightrender aid to the cause which the conference soughtto promote. The chairman had mentioned theAnti— Slavery Reporter. and he (Mr. Thompson)would mention another publication, the Anti-SlaveryAdvocate. a monthly periodical, which mightbe procured for one penny, and would be found tocontain not only the soundest doctrines, but themost important information. It richly deserved tobe extensively supported. The ladies might domuch good, by sending annually to the Anti-SlaveryBazaar their contributions, which would notonly assist the funds of the American Society, butwould greatly , by their sympathy so evinced,their sisters who were engaged in the greatstruggle on the other side of the Atlantic. Afterexpressing his hope that the proceedings of theconference and of that meeting would largely contributeto advance the freedom of the slave, Mr.Thompson resumed his seat amidst much applause,having moved the following resolution: — Anti— Slavery Reporter. Anti-SlaveryAdvocate.  Resolved, That this meeting cordially confirms theproceedings of the anti-slavery conference this day hold,and would express its earnest hope that the publicationof its protects, and the carrying out of its plans, willcontribute largely to the  if those high and holyobjects, for the attainment of which that conference wasconvened; and this meeting expresses its determinationheartily ti support the North of England Anti-Slaveryand India  under whose      Mr. J.C. DYER seconded the resolution. YER The resolution was then put to the vote, and carriedunanimously. The Rev. J.A. STEINTHAL, of Bridgewater, moveda vote of thanks to the chairman, for presiding thatday. He took occasion, at the same time, to recommendthe Anti-Slavery Advocate, publishedmonthly in Dublin; and he also requested the ladiesto render whatever aid they could to the Anti-Slavery. TEINTHAL Anti-Slavery Advocate  Mr. G. Thompson, in seconding the resolution, the  whichthe , that day. had received from thepress; and especially, he alluded to the very report which was being prepared for the
