Dr.  moved a resolution of sure of the pre-slavery, and of praise of the very. American  and of praise of the of the American Anti-Slavery Society. In the you received last work in the Manchester paper,  of the  gentleman was of the Docter's  sentiments. As he is aman of great , and a writer is a paper  in the pertant that you should know what he really did I therefore subjoin a verbatim report of his so for as they appertain to the American Anti-Society: —                     'You have listened to the resolutions Thompson has expressed an opinion in one of than and I am not clear whether I can commit myself regard to that opinion of the American Anti-Society. , I shall not enter upon say sion in regard to the matter, with reference to there may be some diversity of opinion have already stated that I stand on this as a platform, because I recognize the Anti-Slavery to be one of human liberty. We have not most  religious creeds. (Hear.) I fully sentiment of Mr. Pillsbury, when he he said, ' I disbeliever in American Christianity." I love Christianity of the Bible; but I consider that the ciples and the conduct of the members of the American are utterly at variance with the Bible, and an outrage upon all that is true, just lovely, and of good report in the gospel of tainly have resolved, under the influence of much ing which I have experienced since I came to thising,to be more faithful to the anti-slavery have been. I must , that my attention been turned to the subject of late years as it have been. I have been melted, this afternoon,the influence of the most pathetic statements have heard. My spirit has been excited with dignation while I listened to those details of the  atrocities which are perpetrated in that calling itself the land of freedom, and, it grieves say, sanctioned by persons who have named the of Jesus Christ, and who profess to be minister followers of Him, who declared his mission preach the gospel to the poor, to proclaim the captive, the opening of the prison door to then are bound, to bind up the broken-hearted, andclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. Oh, Iunderstand with what light those men read bles,who can quote scripture in support of But as our time has expired, and as there are two persons to speak in support of these will now merely state, that I shall make very short speech by promising that I will bring this ject annually before my congregation, and that bear the sorrows and the wrongs of the poor prayers more frequently when I approach, in my capacity, the throne of the Divine grace. I trust that meeting shall not have been in vain this afterbelieve that every one amongst us has been more thoughtfulness upon the subject, and to the station of more energy and activity than we have displayed. I regret that there has amongst us here the most trifling difference of I think it is right, however, that every should have an opportunity afforded him, in a of conscience, to express his sentiments. I cord with the opinion propounded by Mr. respect to some little matters; but I quite Mr. Thompson's expression, that here we to differ on these matters, and concur in doing can to promote the interests of the gospel of and the welfare and happiness of the human (Cheers.)                                                                      Rev. J.H. SMITHSON (Swedenborgian) said with regard to the abolition of slavery, there but one opinion, namely, that it was their duty in every form in which it could be exhibited to every kind of assistance which would enable them ually to carry the great object before them. should therefore vote the thanks of the meeting to brethren in America who had rendered their services so far in the great and good work of slavery. (Hear.) MITHSON           THE CHAIRMAN, in reference to the had been made to uniting with certain the ground of their heterodoxy in theological said— 'I was present at a Bible Society meeting and a very excellent clergyman present sentiment; "If the devil himself were to come ward, and advocate the diffusion of the Bible out the world, I would not object to it." (Hear laughter.) So is it with reference to anti-slavery do not attend to men's sentiments on other they will only join us in this great work of slavery .' (Hear, hear.') HE HAIRMAN            Rev. S. A STEINTHAL, of Bridgewater. from the anti-slavery society of that district, andfrom the Clifton Ladies ' Anti-Slavery Society, tiated upon the practical means of aiding the very cause, namely, by diffusing information, ingthe American Society's agents and papers, the medium of the Boston Bazaar and scription. In the course of his remarks, Mr. entered his protest against the refusal to hear ker,who he considered was in order. TEINTHAL           Rev. W. PARKMS, as one of the Honorary denied that the refusal to hear Mr. Barker was upon any other ground than that of his being order in respect to time. Had his request been ed,an injustice would have been done to Mr. who had informed the Committee of the was under of laving Manchester by a given which time had then nearly expired. Mr Barker given no such information as to his being leave Manchester, and the Committee had not, fore, been able to make any arrangements to with a convenience to that gentleman of the which they were utterly ignorant. Mr. ward a prior right, from having made his regards time, which Mr. Barker had not hone one of the two could be heard within the time that mained before the train starting, and independany right as acquired by previous application from Ward, the voice of the meeting was unequivocally  in favor of that gentleman. ARKMS                      THE CHAIRMAN made a similar statement. HE HAIRMAN Rev. John Lee considered that if Mr. Barker shown a proper deference to the Chair, there have been no difficulty in his being heard.   Mr. . however, still contended that Barker was in order, as the resolution had been and seconded.    Mr. THOMPSON then submitted two resolutions meeting. The first, upon the important topies of very and the slave trade in Brazil, and which was ly omitted from the Manchester paper, forward you: — HOMPSON       it appears, by returns laid before ment,— from the slave trade correspond lense sign powers, annually printed by government.—the evidences taken before Mr. committees asslave-trade treaties, in the session of 1853,— as well asfrom trustworthy information derived from  that the importation of slaves from Africa the empire of Brazil, which, previously to the 1850, ranged from 25,000 to 70,000 since that period, entirely ceased; and that there  reason to believe, that a very general change opinion on the subject of the slave trade has place  the native Brazilian population:                And, whereas, the legislature of Brazil, in the  of 1850, passed severs laws against parties carry. between Africa and Brazil, anda large sum of money for the a suppression squadron no the         appears that the executive to have honestly, zealously,carried out the intentions in these enactments, by prosecuting the most notorious among by releasing slaves when found on the coast, and by taking  encouragement of free emigration from            in many important official quarters in that free labor is cheaper than taken root and to be        Conference records with joy and grateful to all the friends of of the abolition by Brazil of on an external slave the sovereign, the  of the Brazilian empire, steadily and honorable  have entred, and would assure,both of the government, in their present  of the accursed traffic in  their future exertions to establish results, security and  their important and widely-                      had reference to British India, in the report.    gentleman, formerly residentthe resolutions, described the and the slave trade in Brazil, as that country.     the attention of the meeting to of the Slave Power of the  the territory on the banks of the their intrigues to prevent the  Brazil.         a vote of thanks to the , and said;—'As Mr. Steinthal opinion, and one or two given by gentlemen upon the Mr. Barker, and as my humble the wate along with theirs, I the subject.
