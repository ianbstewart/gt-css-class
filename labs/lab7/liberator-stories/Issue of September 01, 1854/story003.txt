 thy, and fort. But you,tinction of country or . and true Christianitydemands that good shall be done  to all men as can be found. An endeavor has beenmade by 'the Conference' indicated, to originatean expression of English opinion and feeling,which shall gather  as it passes from onepart of the kingdom to another, until, crossing theAtlantis, it shall fill with shame the supporters ofslavery, and impart courage and hope to the mindsof the abolitionists. The details given by the Rev.Mr. BISMOT. of Liverpool, respecting the slave auctionwhich he recently witnessed in Richmond; andthe atrocities described by Mr. PILLSBURY as occurringeverywhere throughout the slaveholdingStates of a country beasting of its free institutions,and baptized with the merciful name ofChristianity, occasioned in the auditory to whichthe speakers addressed themselves, a thrill of horrorwhich shall not soon be forgotten. We believethat many a silent resolution was formed beforethe public resolutions were passed, unceasinglyto protect against American slavery, and toemploy every legitimate agency and influence tohasten the time of its overthrow. The platform.on Tuesday, was occupied by influential ministersand Christians of various religious denominations.We are aware that diversity of religious creed hasbecome a disturbing element in reference to 'TheAmerican Anti-Slavery Society, ' and to those whoin our own country are anxious to promote thegreat object which it seeks to accomplish. It wasremarked, however. by Dr. M' KERROW, that heconsidered the question before the Conference to beone, not of theological creeds—not of any form oftheoretical belief— but of human right in oppositionto injustice, of human liberty in oppositionto bondage, of human happiness in oppositionoppression and misery, and that he saw no reasonwhy all men, irrespective of sect or party, shouldnot unite to deliver humanity from the terribleevils which slavery entails. We understand that'the churches' in America have advanced thecharge of 'infidelity' against some of the mostzealous and self-denying abolitionists in that country,and have thus endeavored to weaken their influenceeverywhere. Were their opinions evensuch as they are represented to be, still, we wouldmaintain that matters of faith lie between everyman's conscience and his Maker; and it is gratifyingto think, that if an erroneous creed be held,it has not eradicated the virtues of pity for thewretched, and of patient labor for the freedom ofthe enslaved. Happy would it be for the interestsof pure Christianity were it not dishonoredand injured by the selfishness, the cold-heartedness,and the cowardice of not a few of those whoare the possessors of what they term 'an orthodoxcreed.' the 'infidelity' from which the religionof Christ has ever suffered most, is that which hasassumed his name, and yet perverted his truth;while, for the sake of worldly ease or wealth, ithas either committed or connived at the most flagrantoutrages on the justice, the mercy, and thebrotherly love of the Gospel. It is, no doubt, pleasantto associate with those who agree with us inall our religious as well as political opinions; andwe should be happy to see those who are too conscientiousto stand on the same common ground ofhumanity and benevolence, and who confine themselvesto the select est company, uniting on theirown religious basis, to assist the Anti-Slaverycause. It appears to us, however, to be nothingbut the most miserable cant and hypocrisy to objectto general organization, on the plea of disliketo the professed or supposed creed of this man orof that, while no special effort is made to abolish acrime a gainst God, Christianity and humanity, themost atrocious on which the light of heaven continuesto fall. The union of Christian ministersdisplayed at the Conference, and the unsparing remonstrancewith the American churches. on accountof their gross inconsistency of conduct, cannotfail, we trust, to be productive of some salutaryresult. If it be the Christianity of Americato support ministers and missions by the labor andsale of slaves—to mutilate books and tracts—deprivingthem of all reference to liberty and equalityin the ight of God. lest offence should be givento the vilest national prejudice and of the mostmistaken of national interests—to send the Gospelto the heathen abroad, while it is criminal to teachthe colored bondmen at home to read and write—then Christians in England must declare, as wassaid by Mr. WARD, 'This is not the Christianityof Christ,' and the churches on the other side ofthe Atlantic must be treated with the practical applicationof their own argument against thosewhom they call infidels.                    ISMOT.  ILLSBURY ERROW  ARD It is said that such speeches and resolutions asthose of the Conference only exasperate the peopleof America. This may be true to some extent.The worker of any kind of iniquity is always displeasedwith the exposure and denunciation of hisevil deeds. But was Christ unwise when he rebukedthe Scribes and Pharisees and hypocritesof his day? Did either he or his apostles measureduty by the degree of anger which their teachingswere likely to excite ? Was ever any good done byany patriot or reformer, who did not utter his sentimentsboldly ? But the anti-slavery party inAmerica need to be encouraged by the expressionof English sympathy and approval. This is certain.that nothing could be more unfaithful to 'theChristianity of Christ'—nothing more disastrousto the interests of humanity— nothing more depressingto the hopes of the friends of freedomthroughout the world— nothing more encouragingto the mammonism and cruelty that make merchandiseof the bodies and souls of man, than thesilence of the British public on the subject ofAmerican slavery. The work of agitation hasagain been commenced in this quarter. It has ourbest wishes for its prudent, uncompromising, andzealous prosecution, and for its speedy and completesuccess.
