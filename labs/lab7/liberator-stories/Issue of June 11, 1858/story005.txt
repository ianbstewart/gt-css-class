 'UNREASONABLE MEN.' The American Presbyterian,N.S., Anti-Slavery, of which Rev. AlbertBarnes is an associate editor, says: NREASONABLE EN. 'When moderate and reasonable men desire to dogood, the Tappans, Cheevers, and this whole classof impracticables, are ever present to binder and retardthe work of national reform. These are themen that really prevent the truth from having freecourse, and render it necessary to preach the Gospelwith much contention.' This is painfully true, and the list of mischiefmakers might be greatly extended.â€”New York Observer. New York Observer.
