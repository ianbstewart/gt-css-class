Timedoes not seem to temper their zeal with discretion.The sentiments expressed were a curious mixture oframpant Anti-Slavery intolerance, a slight dash ofcommon sense, with any amount of political crotchectsand crudities, treasonable denunciations of theUnion, which Wendell Phillips wished to send tothe devil, and frothy ravings against the religiousinstitutions of the country.—Milford (N.H.)
