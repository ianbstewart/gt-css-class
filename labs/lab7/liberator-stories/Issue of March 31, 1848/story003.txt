Resolved, That we believe slavery to be not onlyan evil, but a sin in the sight of God, and that thesystem under every modification is utterly opposed tothe spirit and principles of the gospel. Resolved, That we deem it the duty of everyChristian, in the meekness and spirit of the gospel,to plead the cause of the poor; to remember in theirprayers, these that are in bonds as bound with them;and by all moral and proper means, seek to bastrathe entire removal of the system from our land. Resolved, That we can have no Christian or ministerialfellowship with those who hold their fellowmenas property, or advocate slaveholding as eithera right, or no sin.
