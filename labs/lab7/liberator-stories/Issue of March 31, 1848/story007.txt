 BROTHER LEE:â€”Believing as I do, that slaveryshould be exposed in all its lurking places, and althoughit may demand a seat in the sanctuary ofGod, yet the diabolical system should be exposedfrom the house-top. ROTHER EE Out United Brethren friends have been preachingthat they are also free from the sin of slavery; andI have no doubt dust many of them believe it, andrejoice is that they think it is tree. But the secretis revealed, that slavery is also lurking in thatchurch. New for the proof I have been verycredibly informed by a member of good standingin the United Brethren church, that he had, a fewweeks age, entertained one of their Bishops fromthe State of Virginia, who was traveling to theWest, by the same of Bishop Glosbrener, who informedhim that there are, at this time, slaveholdersof our, Wesleyan brethren, also resides in thebounds of my circuit, heard the Bishop say thename things at another alone and place. TheBishop also remarked, that the brethren in theState of Virginia did not view the subject in thesame light that the brethren of the North do. Alsothat some of them have married wives who holdslaves, and the husbands could not emancipate, &c.There things were told to me in the presence ofquite a number of persons some who are membersof the M.E. Church, who remarked, 'That is thecase with Bishop Andrew and Harding.' they are also free from the sin of slavery Now, brethren in Christ, do not let us apologizefor slavery under some circumstances, as I haveseen in one case already, since the Bishop has passedthis way, but labor to remove the monster from thechurch, and if that cannot be accomplished, removethe church from the monster. Yours for consistency, B. TRESONRIDER. RESONRIDER. Jamestown, O., Jan. 28,1848.
