 How comes it that the slaveholders have, thusFar, exercised a preponderating influence in theGovernment, taxation, and general policy of theseUnited States? Because there has been one kind of representationFor the slaveholders, and another for Northernfreemen. About a hundred thousand voters, slave-owners,Return twenty Members of Congress on account ofTheir slaves—more than one twelfth of the whole.A cargo of Africans, heavily ironed and smuggledinto Texas from Cube or Africa, may control thevote of the State, or the policy of the Union.—Consult the votes of Congress, end mark how differentits measures have been, had Southernproperty been withheld from the basis of representation,Who ever heard of 'the principle of allowingparts of a nation political power in proportionto the number of men they hold in bondage,'except here? property By this arrangement, the South gained 7 membersin the first Congress. From 1795 to 1813, the South gained fourteenfrom 1813 to 1823, nineteen; from 1823 to 1833twenty-two; from 1833 to 1843, twenty-five. Now, the North sends 138 Representatives toCongress for her 9,727893 freemen, being one.member for each 70,449; the Sooth sends 87Representatives for each 55,725 free men, there being;only 44,818,105 free persons within the slaveStates. In the Presidential election next fall, the Northwill have 166 electoral votes; the South 117; thatis, an electoral vote for every 52,576 freemen in theNorth, and the name for every 41,435 freemen inthe slave states. Of these, TWENTY electoral votes are given tothe south on account of bar property in slaves,and to encourage her to get more slaves, extendslavery far and wide, and thereby retain politicalpower. If slaves are merely property, like cattle, whyshould Southern negroes be represented more thannorthern machinery and spindles? Texas has been annexed, with slavery; hundredsof millions of dollars bare been expended inFlorida, Mexico, and our South and West, to secureto a hundred thousand slaveholders a continuanceof political power. Direct taxation, in war,is avoided in every possible case, because it wouldfall on the South in proportion to her representation.Her politicians prefer to tax tea and coffee,because, in that case, the free work people of theNorth would bear the burden. Slaves don't drinktea. In 1836, there were about 37 1-2 millions of surplusrevenue for distribution. Less than four millionsof Southern freeman got 16 millions—morethan seven millions of Northern freemen, had only21 1-2 millions. Each freeman, South, had 420Cents—each Northern freeman only 305. TheSouth actually received a bonus, in 1837, of $3186,127,On account of her slave property, and toEncourage her to increase it, although the proceedsof direct taxation that have come into the U.S.Treasury since 1789, on account of slave property,will not amount to two millions. Southern During the revolution, Massachusetts, with475,257 people, sent 68,007 soldiers to the Continentalarmy, and 15,155 militia. The six slaveStates, with their free population of 1,307,549,furnished only 59,336 soldiers far the same army,and 10,123 militta.
