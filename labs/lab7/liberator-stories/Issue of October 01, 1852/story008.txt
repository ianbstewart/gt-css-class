 This public impostor said in Faneull Hall theother day, that he formerly pledged himself not tovote for pro-slavery Presidents only while the territorialquestion was open. And is it not open now?Did not he and his 'dad' vow to be true to the BuffaloPlatform, all of it?—to 'repeal all compromises' whichmight be made?—and 'fight ever' till all its principleswere carried out? Certainly. In the summer of 1849, we attended with him thegreat Northwest Convention at Cleveland, and hadfull, free conversation with him respecting the intentionof the N.Y. Bamburners. We told him a fearwas beginning to be felt, that they might not maintaintheir ground. He assured us that there was notthe least occasion for any apprehension. Theywould certainly prove faithful to their public faith,and to those who had generously trusted them.How, said be, can we do otherwise, if we would?Our reputation is all pledged, and however poor, itis still worth something to those of us who haveled off there. Why should we wish to damn ourselvesto infamy? And without us, poor devils aswe may be, the masses will not be likely to retreatNo, you may dismiss all your fears about the Barnburners.We told him the fear lay in regard to thenext Presidential election, but be declared theywould stand the test at all hazards. Now where ishe? But no matter. Christianity, freedom, humanity,has its traitors, whose example is worth morethan their aid. So with Judas; so with Arnold; sowith Van Buren.—Portland Inquirer. Portland Inquirer. JOHN VAN BUREN DEAD!—John Van Buren said,at Cleveland, in 1848:— OHN AN UREN EAD 'I am, however, the unmitigated enemy of slavery,and would have it ABOLISHED WITHOUT DELAY. Isay, therefore, for myself—and I wish to be understoodas speaking for myself alone—that, let whatwill come, I shall, under no necessity whatever, supporta man WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE SLAVERY TO BE ANUNMIXED CURSE, and who will not, by virtue of hisoffice, use all constitutional power to ABOLISH it.'* * * 'I shall tire and DIE by it.' 'I am, however, the unmitigated enemy of slavery,and would have it I shall, under no necessity whatever, supporta man and who will not, by virtue of hisoffice, use all constitutional power to ABOLISH it.'* * * 'I shall tire and DIE by it.'

RINCE OHN.  ridiculous He claims that the question of slavery in this nationis no longer an open question, &c Poor man!it is most unfortunate for him, that he has thus deliberatelyconcluded to deceive himself, and makeshipwreck of his professed principles. His folly isonly equalled by the man who shots his eyes at midday,and declares there is no son, or by him who getsupon the railroad track, and declares there is noengine advancing to harm him. John Van Burenwill sometime, perhaps, have occasion to know thesun of Liberty has not set, neither has the car ofFreedom ceased to move. He may hug his delusion,till aroused by the wheel of progress thatcrushes his hopes to the dust; but sooner or later hewill be made to reel the doom of a traitor. No man can go back in any righteous cause withoutmeeting a Webster's fate. People at once loseconfidence in such a man, and they will never givehim their suffrage.
