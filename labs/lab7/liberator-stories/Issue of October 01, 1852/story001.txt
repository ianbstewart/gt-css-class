 ☞'Yes! it cannot be divided—the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of theirassent to the Constitution, three special provision tosecure the perpetuity of their dominion over theirslaves. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African slave trade; the second wasthe stipulation to surrender fugitive slaves—an engagementpositively prohibited by the laws of God,delivered from Sinai; and, thirdly, the exaction, fatato the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor slaves—for articles of merchandize, underthe name of persons. . . To call government thus constituteda democracy, is to insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slavery. It reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of the nation is to establish an artificialmajority in the slave representative over that of thefree people, in the American Congress; and therebyto make the PRESERVATION, PROPAGATIONAND PERPEUTATION OF SLAVERY THE VITALAND ANIMATING SPIRIT OF THE NATIONALGOVERNMENT.'—JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.
