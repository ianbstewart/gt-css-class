 ☞"What order of men under the most absolute ofmonarchies, or the most aristocratic of republics, was everinvested with such an odious and unjust privilege as thatof the separate and exclusive representation of less thanhalf a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this House,in the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential mansion?This investment of power in the owners of onespecies of property concentrated in the highest authoritiesof the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of thetwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privilegedorder of men in the community, to the rightsof all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole,than any order of nobility over knows. To call governmentthus constituted a Democracy is to insult the understandingof mankind. . . .It is doubly tainted with theinfusion of riches and of slavery. There is no name inthe language of national jurisprudence that can define it—no modal in the records of ancients history, or in the politicaltheories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. Itwas introduced into the Constitution of the United Statesby an equitation—a representation of property under thename of persons. Little did the members of the Conventionfrom the Free states imagine or foresee what a sacrificeto Moloch was hidden under the mask of this concession."—JOHN QUINCY ADAMS. OHN UINCY DAMS.
