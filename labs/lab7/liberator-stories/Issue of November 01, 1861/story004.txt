 Dr. Cheever, since his return from Europe, hasbeen tailoring with might and main to accomplishthe destructive ends of his patrons in England, fromwhom he received money to keep up his church.yesterday, he poured forth one of his customary incendiaryabolition harangues, calculated to disturbthe action of the Federal government, excite insurrectionin the loyal States, and afford indirect aid tothe rebellion which is distracting the country. ThePuritan Church found itself, with its pastor, in sucha dilapidated financial position some months since,that Dr. Cheever went abroad for the purpose ofRising money to keep his establishment a-going.How much he obtained from his Exeter Hall mendshas not been divulged; but be certainly got enoughto entitle those who gave him their contributions, inorder that his abilities as an ecclesiastical demagoguemight not be lost, in the grant work of underminingfree institutions, and upsetting American nationality,to feel sure that he would employ all his energies mtheir behalf. He is proving himself to be a faithfulagent of our enemies; bat be ought, none the less,to be silenced by the authorities, and shut up at FortLafayette, or elsewhere, where law capacity for mischiefwill be more limited. Where Bencher, Cheever,Greeley, Garrison, Raymond, and others of thatstripe, who are daily reviling our patristic President,and sowing discord in the Northern States, are putunder look and key, the last obstacle will have beenremoved to entire unity of feeling and action thisside of the Potomac.â€”New York Herald.
