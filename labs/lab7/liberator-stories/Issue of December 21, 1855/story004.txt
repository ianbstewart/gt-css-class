 Our Southern slave-driving brethren have longenjoyed a reputation for comfortable self-complacencyand modest rance quite unparalleled,unless indeed we ought to accept the cases of thefamous ttle immortalized in fable, and the no famous  immortalized in parable, who hadno other greeting for his neighbor than that one of "Stand , I am holier than th.

It for them to attempt any longer to with the South  slave-drivers and-ters, so admitbly  in the and speaking as emphatically by the voice of Mr.Adams the  of that  little State.Of course we allude in the justification  forthby the said Mr. Adams in  tothe South  for his piece of  ill  and significant of the small  which or  have yet made in that part of theworld, or can be expected ever to snake in a slave-holdingcommunity—in returning with an  to the Governor of Massachusetts certain which the Legislature of that  hadpassed on  of national , and whichGov.  had been  to  tothe  of all the States with a respect tolay them before their  Legislature.                                   These  to the between Southern slaveholders and daughters to  slavery they expressed the  of Massachusettsnot to submit to that ,— resolution, of  were not, very muchto Gov.

Now taking late  some which have  in the and diplomatic  between South and Massachusetts, and certain  ofSouth Carolina  to  theState of Massachusetts and her  of therights  to them by the Constitution ofthe United States, this fine  of injured cibilityand right indignation on the part ofGov. Adams must be cut down no decidedly themost impudent thing of which we  overto have heard. We might, in  challenge everWise himself, or The  or Cushing,to beat it. The facts to which we  was notdone in a corner. They are familiar to everybody.South Carolina, years age a law for , and  certain , slavery, every colored , who, drivenby  or in pursuit of his lawful should come within  borders. This act was a violation of the Federal Constitution by aJudge of the Supreme Court of the United States,himself a native and a citizens of South Carolina,and this opinion was sustained by the legal generally throughout the country. NeverthelessSouth Carolina still , in spite of repeatedremonstrances, in Impriing colored citizensof Massachusetts, and in  extortingmoney from them in the same of jail face, underthe threat that unless they submitted to this placeof petty , they should he said into slavery.Finally, Massachusetts sends an spent to South Carolinafor the express purpose of making a bringing the question of the of this legislation, and of these kidnapping operations,and petty plundering, before the SupremeCourt of the United States. That agent—a mostrable and  citizens—in, with his daughter, forcibly driven out of the State bya  compd of the leading citizens of Charleston,with threats that he shall be rred andfathered and worse if he reburns: and this action is adopted and basked up by the Legislatureof South Carolina by the  of a lawby which the coming into the State, for the purposeof instituting any suit  to tact theconstitutionally of impning offense of Massachusettsopening them of their money, and them into slavery, is made a highly  offense!And at the fact of all this, Gov. Adamsundertakes to read Massachusetts a lecture thout'unblushingly'—as though among the other extensiveprogatives of the slaveholders was thatof never blushing at any —' and of impiously'—as though the slaveholders were madeupon earth—' violating her constitutional tions!'                                                    What a treasure Gov, Adams would be toof our enterprising city , if theyonly lay hold of him! Net all the  ofLake Superior and the size- of New together would he able to afford such an supply of material. The next timeSouth Carolina has  to found wherewith to  the enforcement of the lawsof the United States, we should advice her by allmeans to cast Gov. Adams bodily into the meltingpot. So patriotic,  an individualwould certainly not  to such a phonic. Indeed, in fancy we  him open-mouth,and in the proposes of being transformed into a piece of the blunder order,  forthalready fire and  in  of the Constitutionalrights of South Carolina; of course, stilltrue to his South Carolina , he  be expected to  of in  of any otherState.  enough  it, in all and plenty of spoke and tow-wedding; but somehow or other, the  to be .                             Indeed, if we are to put implicit confidence inthe  of  Adam's, the time in which his  the  capacity will be imperatively needed, is rapidlyapproaching—as  the following paragraph:         The  in  to slavery  to and , which it was in the country and  to  have but  of abolition.  are .
