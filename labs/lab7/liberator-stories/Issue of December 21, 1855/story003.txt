 LR K.T., Thursday, Nov. 15. R  The evening session met at six o'clock, Gov.Shannon took his , and called the meeting toorder. As soon as he did so, a cry for Gen. Calhounwas raised. He appeared and said, in substance,as follows:—  GEN. CAL'S SPEECH-OFFICIAL REPORT.  GENTLEMEN:—I stand on Kansas ground. I stoodon it before the passage of the Kansas-NebraskaBill, and stand ready now to  the lawscreated under its provisions. I stood by the Kansas-NebraskaAct in Illinois, and I stood by it inthe Halls of Congress, and still hold that it is theprinciple of the Government that the people shallrule. 'Tis the doctrine of the Declaration of Independence;'tis the great charter of Americanfreemen that the people the right to rule.The people must determine whether they will haveslavery or not. The abolitionists want to rule, bysaying that the people shall not have the right torule themselves. When Douglas  proclaimedthe  of States' Rights, who  up against Seward,  Giddings say itis wrong, and so they said of the Bill of 1850. Thepeople have the right to govern themselves. Whenthe Nebraska Bill was firat introduced the States'Rights men were all for it, and the abolitionists allagainst it. There we have our States' Rights men;but abolitionists are around you, and they  atTope, and framed a Constitution. This matter you must consider well. Shall abolitionistsrule you! (No! Never! &C.) Give themall they demand, and abolitionism, becomes the lawof the Government. You yield, and you will havethe most infernal Government that ever cursed aland. I would rather be a painted slave over inthe State of Missouri, or a  to the  of Russia,than have the abolitionists in power. (DeafeningCheers.) Gentlemen, you came here topledge yourselves to the support of the law. Whydo the abolitionists say there is no law? Lookaway down to the State of Massachusetts, and youwill find the reason. They well said that they willdo all they could to establish laws of their ownmanufacture. They have incorporated a companywith a capital of $5,00,000 to make KansasABOLITION State. (Cheers.) They have publishedan address to the citizens of Missouri that theydid not want Kansas a free State. There is sometruth in it. Their object was not to  Kansasa free State, but an abolition State. (Cheers.)How do they try to do it? Look at their paperspublished throughout the United States. They areall Know Nothing or abolition . (Cheers.)Lock at the outrages mentioned in their journals—of  shot through the sides of  and soforth. (Laughter.) There  nothing so low ormean, but abolition papers  found to fall it.We the Unlop-oving States' Rights men of Kansas,have kept too still, and allowed the nullifiers toproclaim millions of lies. The States' Rights menhave no political difficulties; but if you go to theabolition  States, they will ask, when the fightingwill came to an end! (He then alluded to the of Laughlin and Callin, and said, 'I don'twish to see any body killed, but I like the States'Rights men to conquerer.) (Cheers.) All our difficultiesare made by the abolitionists of Massachusetts. ENTLEMEN       have                When Reader was-appointed Governor of Kansas,be was supposed to be a Democrat. He camehere, called an election, and afterwards gave to theRepresentatives  of , thereby declaringthem legally elected, and ordered them to Legislative  at . The not  the Governor  a properplace for the Legislature to  it  given himthe vote power. By  toheld the  at to did all he was  todo. They were not  to . They. But now  they  it! They placedon  to  the Legislature to . The Governor  it. They then it almost  over his hand, and a kindvote made it a law, notwithstanding the Governorhad  it. This statement one I  Still that they had  and that all made after they  were By  to Mission they had his  to  had  his the laws they  were a about this  of  my own and I can  of .                                                       that have been there being times as well as , and this is the his votes. Look to Massachusetts and you will findthey wanted him to  this . Theywanted to me him. This to not a legal election.                   But now look to Washington. For will one amajority of abolitionists in the  butnot in the Senate; and thank God! the Presidentis a States' Rights men. (Prolonged Cheers.)Gov. Reeder is not a great man: not much of aman; the question is too large for him; but hedepends upon the lower .   Up to the 5th of September nothing was knownof a  Convention. I had not heard a of it; but it was started at the  of Chase.Giddings &Co. to make a  in the nextPresidential election. He has no right to seat inCongress; and from what did the right  tocall a Convention to frame a free State Constitutionto present to Congress! They proclaims thatwe have no law and no right—accept to  niggers.This was not a free State Convention, but anabolition Convention. Free State men or States'Rights men are always found ready to vindi therights of the South, and are safe to be trusted.And in free or slave States, the safe men are theStates' Rights to men. This Convention was starteda way down in Massachusetts and the men whostarted it were of the abolition —moretools (cheers) of Chance, Sumner, Seward &Co.,who wanted to use it in the next Presidential election.That Topeka Convention was made up ofabolitionists who made on abolition Convention,(cheers.) Chance, Sumner &Co. know who to callupon. Call upon the abolitionists, you can nothelp from them, they say. If, upon the presentationof the Topeka Constitution Kansas is received as afree State, we can then elect on abolition presidentor perhaps, effect a  of the Union.Look at it. Will the South have an abolition Stateforced on us, or stand up and  her rights!Will she have an abolition President or a dissolutionof the Union, and an abolition Republic towar upon the rights of the South!           If Kansas is not admitted as a free State, theywill charge upon Douglas for introducing the KansasNebraska Bill for the purpose of making Kansasa slave State. Those abolitionists are goodpoliticians. They will resort to any kind of meanor misrepresentation. I would not trust aFree Soiler or abolitionist out of sight. (Loudcheers.) I would not believe one of them under more than the  wretch that licks the from the meantoutlary. They would to the devil and presence him a God, if hewould but help them to steal a nigger. (Prolongedand  cheers.)       Prolongedand  cheers.  And again if Mr. Douglas should vote for the of Kansas into the Union as a free State,be  not got the  vote of the South forthe Presidency, and would be like a out in a certainplace—without claws. (Cheers and laughter.)    This is  question for the abolitionists tomake capital from. We must not allow it to growhere. We must stop its growth. It tramplupon the laws of the land. Say to your Governor—enforce the laws: we will stand by you; and, ifnecessary, we will spill our life's blood to enforce. The Governor will be with you. (Deafeningcheers.) If the laws are unconstitutional, theymust be repealed at the proper tribunal. Untilthey are repealed, they are the law of the land, andshould be enforced. The Governor calls for all tohelp him except abolitionists. (Laughter andcheers.) His call in to  from all States, but hedon't want abolitionists. Will you all stand byhim! ( of 'yes!' 'yes! we will!)Is there one that will not stand by him! (Cries of'No!').      The speaker have read a letter addressed, by Rev.Mr. Boyd, to the New York Tri, and then asked, Tri  'Who is he? (C of nder and laughter.)I know him, He is a preacher from the State ofIlli, and out of four abolitionists, and he is one ofthem; though so king as abolitionist, that allshowed him. The  made by him to afalsehood; name of the friends of  have abolitionists. Men of high, lefty and inspiredStates' Rights principles turn abolitionists?Never! Though, unfortunately, some did rots forReader and the delegates to the Topka ,which was in violation of all law. They alreadyregree it. But lot these go . We have butone duty to perform,  stand up boldly anddo it, and I will help to do it.  I expectto live here and make Kansas my home, and I livefor my country; and whatever I may do, andwhatever it is done, I expect to do it for my country.And although I have  as for beingpoor, and  for  here and,in , I live  my country; and asa  and though a poor man, I and on honorable one;  of good,) and ifI should not have any thing to leave for my children,I can say, here is the  of theUnited States—the  and  to a daughter .                           At  were  in the  half of  for  had  and to speak. He was  with  and ,and wise of  put him, Out, and other enough  have  the.                       Mr. —.

Mr. , into -candidate for Congress, wasnext called on, and explained, in a few brief remarks,the  of obedience to law in order to the safety of property and preservation oflife. He said that he find  the of  a similar  last spring to enforcethe  of law on all . He fully Mr. Calboun's sentiments, he said, andIf he had the tongue  in heard in every part ofthis Union he would repeat it, that all might hearit. Let on  that speech  with us, ever it, and  up in the morning determined toenforce the laws; even, if necessary, with ,and though blood should  as freely as the bid waters of the Missouri. (Loud cheers.)                    Mr. D.M. Johnson (one of the preminent lenders,it will be remembered, in the  of Mr.Phillips last spring) was next called on. He said:  'GENTLEMEN: I  the laws in full, and coincidewith what has already been said, and considerthe members of the Topeka Convention astraitors. Roder was at the  of it. He is atraitor to his country, (cheers,) and a traitor atheart. (Cheers.) But he is dead! The suicidalknife has been  in his heart, and politicaloblivion must be his winding-shout. The delegatesthat  at the Topeka Convention were all traitorsto their country, and Reeder is the man whohas started all . I do not like to seemen pro to be  and order men, when talkingto law and order men, and in all public speechesdenounce the laws  unconstitutional and illegal.(Cheers.) Those  are the wor enemies wehave among us.' (Cheers.) ENTLEMEN            Cries were raised for Mr. Stringfellow. Dr. Stringellow came forward and said that hedid not wish to risk his reputation as a publicspeaker, by adding anything to the eloquent speechon that had already been uttered, but he dorsedtheir sentiments. He concluded, by morningthat the Convention adjourn till to morrow morning.Carried.  P.S. Who represented now!  ofI? Cany man doubt, after reading the proceedingsof the Pro-Slavery Convention, that my importof his Westport speech was correct! Lot theJournal of Commerce and Washington Union reply.
