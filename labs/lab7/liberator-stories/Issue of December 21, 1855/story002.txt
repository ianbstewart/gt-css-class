 SILVER SPRINGS, (Md.,) Dec. 1, 1855. ILVER PRINGS GENTLEMEN Having relinquished political employment,and, to avoid encountering again itsanxieties, addicted myself to country life, I amconstrained to decline your invitation to join theRepublican Association of Washington City, althoughtempted by the honor of becoming its presidingofficer. Yet I feel it my duty to say, thatin the main, I concur in the aims of the AssociationTo exclude slavery from the Territories ofthe United States, and to rebuke the violation ofthe Compromises, which were made to stand ascovenants between the Slave and Free States to effectthat exclusion, are, in my opinion, the mostimportant movements which have engaged thepublic mind since the Revolution. ENTLEMEN The extension of slavery over the new territorieswould prove fatal to their prosperity; butgreatest calamity to be apprehended from it isthe destruction of the Confederacy, on which thewelfare of the whole country reposes. Every conquestof this element of discord, which has so oftenthreatened the dissolution of the Union, increasethe danger. Every surrender of the Free Statesinvites invasion. The cause which your organization is intendedpromote may well draw to its support men ofall parties. Differences on questions of policy, ofconstitutional construction, of modes of administrationmay well be merged, to unite men who believethat nothing but concert of action on the partof those who would arrest the spread of slavery,can resist the power of the combination now embodiedto make it embrace the Continent fromocean to ocean. The repealing clause in the Kansas Bill is predicatedon the nullity of the clause in the Constitutionwhich gives Congress the power 'to makeregulations respecting the Territories' of the UnitedStates. Yet nothing is clearer in the history ofour Government than that this phrase, giving powerto Congress 'to make regulations respectingthe Territories,' was meant to give it the power toexclude slavery from them. Mr. Jefferson's resolution of 1785, declaringthat 'there shall be neither slavery nor involuntaryservitude in any of the States' land off in theWestern Territory, was subsequently renewed inthe Congress of 1785, which added that 'thisregulation shall be on article of compact'; and it wasso voted unanimously by the delegations of eightStates out of twelve. thisregulation shall be on article of compact'; It was passed by the unanimous votes of all theStates by the Congress of 1787, which sat contemporaneouslywith the Convention forming the Constitution,and that Constitution gave Congress thepower to make regulations respecting the Territories,and moreover, affirmed the validity of 'theengagements into before the adoption ofthe Constitution' by the Confederation—one ofwhich engagements was that made by the regulationexcluding slavery from the Territories. Thusthe Congress of the Confederation and the Constitutionframing the Constitution united in givinga double sanction to the exclusion. The first exerted the power of enacting Mr. Jeffersoninterdict of slavery in the Territories Thenby the United States, to which it had previouslygiven an impressive sanction by adding,'this regulation shall be an article of compact,and the Convention guaranteed this 'engagement,uttered into under the Confederation, bydeclaring it valid,' and employed the same terms,'regulation of the Territories,' to transmit thepower here exerted to future Congresses. In theface of this history, and the letter of the Constitutiongranting the power to make whatever regulationsit deemed fit respecting the Territories ofthe United States, the authors of the Kansas andNebraska bill deny the constitutionality of theregulations which exclude slavery from the Territoriesand set at naught all the precedents thatconfirm them, which have followed in uninterruptedsuccession, from the foundation of the government. Then of the Territories The other clause in the Constitution, empoweringCongress to pass laws to prevent the 'migrationor importation' of slaves after 1808, showsthe fixed purpose of the founders of our Union tolimit the increase of this cvil. The consequencewas an inhibition, which prevents a South Carolinano planter, who has slaves in Cuba, from bringingthem to his home plantation; and to remove thisobstruction to the increase of slavery within theUnion, and open Africa to supply the demandmade by the new act, the Northern nullifiers arealready called on by their Southern allies to lendtheir aid; and certainly those who embrace Mr.Calhoun's doctrine, as stated by Mr. Douglas,that 'every citizen has an inalienable right tomove into any of the Territories, with his property,of whatever kind or description,' the Constitutionand Compromises not withstanding, can hardly refuseit. It was on the annexation of the MexicoTerritories that Mr. Calhoun asserted thisprinciple, to unsettle the fixed policy of the nation,beginning with the era of the Declarationof Independence; and he applied it alike to theCompromises of 1820 and 1850. Mr. Douglas thussums up the position taken, and the result:— Under this section, an in the case of the Mexicanlaw in New Mexico and Utah, it is a disputed pointwhether slavery in prohibited in the Nebraska countryby valid enactment. The decision of this question involvesthe constitutional power of Congress to pass lawsprescribing and regulating the domestic institutions ofthe various Territories of the Union. In the opinion ofthose eminent statemen who hold that Congress is investedwith no rightful authority to legislate upon thesubject of slavery in the Territories, the eighth sectionof the act preparatory to the admission of Missouriis null and void, while the prevailing sentiment in alarge portion of the Union sustains the doctrine thatthe Constitution of the United States secures to everycitizen an inalienable right to move into any of theTerritories with his property, of whatever kind anddescription, and to hold and enjoy the same under thesanction of law. Your Committee do not feel themselvescalled upon to enter into the discussion of these controvertedquestion. They involve the same grave issueswhich produced the agitation, the sectional strife, andthe fearful struggle of 1850.' Under this section, an in the case of the Mexicanlaw in New Mexico and Utah struggle of 1850. From this it appears that the Compromises of1820 and 1850 involved the question of the validityof the law of Mexico excluding slavery from thenewly-ceded Mexican Territory, and the law of ourown Congress excluding it from that north of theline of 36  30'. WM. Mr. Douglas's Committee Reportrecommended that, as  Congress deemed it wise and prudent to refrain,from deciding the matter in controveray then either byaffirming or repealing the Mexican laws, or by on actdeclaratory of the true of the Constitution, andthe extent of the protection by it to slave propertyin the Territories, so your Committee are not preparednow to recommend a departure from the coursepursued on that memorable occasion, either by affirmingor repealing the eighth section of the Missouri act,by any act declaratory of the meaning of the Constitutionin respect to the legal points in dispute.' These passage one quested to show that the issuesmade by Mr. Calhoun, as to the constitutionalityof the two Compromises of 1820 and 1850,were expressly left open for judicial decision, bythe committee, who neverthe swept away, bya clause  added to their bill, not onlythe Missouri Compromise of 1820, but also theCompromise of 1850, which left untouched theMexican laws, prohibiting slavery in the codedTerritories, which Webster, Clay, Benton, and allthe leading lights in the Senate, (with the exception of Mr. Calhoun,) pronounced valid, and aneffectual restriction.   The repeal was the adoption of Mr. Calhoun'snullifying doctrine in extence. The power of Congressto make laws excluding slavery for-ever fromits Territories, as such, was denied, and all theTerritories were opened to slavery, on the groundof the ' right' of every citizen 'tomove into my of the Territories with his property,of Whatever kind and description;' and the law ofsquatter sovereignty was superadded, and substitutedfor the sovereignty of the United States overthe public domain. Thus fell, at the dictation ofMr. Atchison, supported by the coalition effectedbetween the Whigs and Democrats of the South,under the pressure and through the intrigues ofthe Nulliers, Mr. Jefferson's noble principle, endearedto the country both for its moral grandeurand political wisdom. It is the first thought utteredin the Declaration of Independence; and tothe denunciation of the King of Great Britainfor the crime of bringing slavery to our shores,the original draft adds as the deepest aggravation,that 'he has prostituted his negative for suppressingevery legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrainthis  commerce.' in extence.  right  my of the Territories with his property,of Whatever kind and description;  he has prostituted his negative for suppressingevery legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrainthis  commerce.  The first legislative attempt to restrain the progressof the mischief which the King of GreatBritain visited upon this country, was Mr. Jefferson'sresolution excluding slavery from the Territoryof the United States in 1784—the next wasthat introduced by Rufus King, in 1785—the thirdthat of Nathan Dane, in 1787—all receiving thevotes of two-thirds of the States of the Confederacy,and the last  unanimous vote.  The fourth movement was that of the Convention,in the Constitution itself, providing againstthe importation of slaves after 1808, declaring thebinding validity of the engagements entered bythe Congress of the Confederacy on the Governmentof the United States, to exclude it from theTerritory, and ouring to the new Governmentthe power of making similar provision for futureacquisitions of Territory. The fifth regulation torestrain the progress of slavery was that of thecompromise of —the sixth, that of 1850. Itin remarkable, that although these great had their origin with Democratic leaders, Federaland Whig leaders of great renown united in theirsupport. The constitutional provisions on thesubject had the unanimous suffrage of all the illustriousmen in the Convention who framed theConstitution of the United States; and from thesilence on the subject in the State Conventions,called to ratify the Constitution, it may well bepresumed that these also were unanimous in theirapproval of what had been done under the Confederacyand in the new Constitution to restrainthe introduction and limit the extension of slavery,And may not men of all parties now uniteto restore, what the patriots of all parties, duringthe first seventy years of our Government, contributed to establish?    The work of restoration is simple and easy, ifthe men who abhor the late innovation on thelong-settled policy of the nation can be induced torelinquish petty differences on transitory topics,and give their united voice in the next Presidentialelection, for some man, whose capacity, fidelityand courage can be relied upon to oppose theissue which the present Administration has madeto control it. The contest has grown out of Presidentialaspirations. The decision of the people atthe polls, in choosing a Chief Magistrate, will endit. Senators will easily comply, when the nation'sdemand is backed by the existing Presidential powerand patronage, and hopes of the future succession,which always animate the leading membersof the body. The Administration has staked itself on the support party of privilege—of  interest—which  it a unit. It confides in the which has crowned the oligarchy everywhere inthe Old World, and secured its  who on thewaxim, 'Divide and conquer.' The Whigs andDemocrats of the South are a combination, to into the next Presidency some candidate absolutein maintaining the repealing clause of theKansas Bill, which nullifies the principles of the,Ordinance, the provisions of the Constitution.made to give them effect, and all the Compromisewhich have been made in  of them,with the sanction of all ctions of the Union. Ifthe majority favorable to the policy built up withour Government will units, accept the issue tenderedby the Administration, and make THE OF THE REPEALING  OF THE KANSASACT paramount in the impending contest for thePresidency, all will be restored that has been to free institutions, by opening the Territories,North and South, to slavery. The Compromiseof 1820 and 1850  restored, there will not bean  of the territory of the United States,  from slavery, an which it  legallyintrude; and Mr. Atchison's attempt by an armedforce to carry out the nullification plotted of the which gave birth to the Kansas Bill, will,like the attempt of his type, Mr. Calhoun, give effect to South  nullification, be by the frown of  nation, made by an  and .
