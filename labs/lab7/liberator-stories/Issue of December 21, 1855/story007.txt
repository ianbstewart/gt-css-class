 Our correspondent 'M.,' of Philadelphia, desiresus to publish the subjoined card, receivedby him from Mr. Williamson. It is designed, weunderstand, to correct an impression which hefours might be made by the tenor of 'm's' last letter,but which certainly was not produced on ourown mind, that the counsel of Mr. Williamsonevinced a censurable anxiety to get their clientout of prison. We are quite sure that our correspondentnever meant to convey such an idea, forhe has uniformly spoken in terms which forhidany such supposition. It has been one of his greatestout regrets, we know, that Mr. Meredith's final argumentbefore Judge Kane. Which he consideredto the highest degree creditable to the author'sabilities, and satisfactorily cuplanstory of thecourse pursued by Mr. Williamson's counsel, hasnever yet been published. We are happy tolearn,—we may say here in passing,—that that argumentwill be published, and that it is to formpart of a pamphlet history which is about to appearin Philadelphia, giving an account of thewhole transaction.
