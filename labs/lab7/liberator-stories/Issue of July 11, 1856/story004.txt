 It is said that since the flogging of Sumnerby Brooks, all the abolition members of Congeeshave armed themselves with Colt's revolvers, andcarry them in the Halls of Congress What afarce! It is nt reasonable to suppose that theman who would not resent an insult offered, wouldhave the moral courage to draw one of the aforesaidweapons. The abolitionists are great on indignationmeetings, where they are not bodily exposed,but who ever heard of one facing his oppimentin the field, where all such affairs of honorshould be settled? The coward who would not givesatisfaction to an injured party, would not defendhimself from an assault though he should he loadedwith arms.—Kansas Squatter Sovereign. Kansas Squatter Sovereign. YANKEE INDIGNATION. The abolitionists everywehre Northare holding indignation meetings overthe flogging which Mr. Brooks administered toSumner. The white-livered Yankees are great onindignation meetings, but very small at defendingthemselves from personal chastisement. Everymother's son of them deserver just such a caningfrom a Southern gentleman.—Ibid. YANKEE INDIGNATION. Ibid.
