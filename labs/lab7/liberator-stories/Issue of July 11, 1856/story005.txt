Mr. Shorter, of Alabama, in thecourse of a speech in Congress, said:â€” Democratic party, the true exponent ofState rights' principles, triumph in the Presidentialelection, the Union will be saved, but if BlackRepublicanism prevail, the history of our Governmentthe history of our Confederacy will havebeen written. The only way to preserve the Unionis for the true Conservative men of the North,now represented by sound national democracy, tounite with the South, and urge an unceasing waron the fanatics who would tear down the pillarsof our Republic.
