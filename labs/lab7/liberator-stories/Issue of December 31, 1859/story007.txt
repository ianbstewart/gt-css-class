 The Anti-slavery families who have so long madeBoston the seat of this annual social occasion, gratefullyrenew their invitation to all the early friends ofFreedom, and cordially extend it to the multitudes ofnew friends in every part of the land, whom the pastyour has made; earnestly cut resting the satisfactionf their company at BOSTON On Wednesday, January 25th. Soiree at 7o'clock. ☞The general arrangements for the day and eveningthe same as last year. We, who now unite in this heartfelt invitation, arenot of Northern origin exclusively; some are of theSouth, and some have been slaveholders. But all seeingclearly that the present must be a year of unwantedmoral exertion, if our country is to be carriedsuccessfully through the present hopeful crisis, unitein entreating our friends to meet us in this wayat its opening, for mutual understanding and co-operation,counsel and encouragement, sympathy andcongratulation. Never were the signs of the peacefulextinction of slavery so full and propitious to theeyes long trained to read them aright. We shall shortly end special invitations to both theearlier and later friend. In the mean time, we entreatall who love their native land, and are beginning to feeldeeply moved, to save and save it, to consider thenecessity of steady, long-sustained, unremitting exertion,such as we carry on, and to uphold it now bypresence, if possible—at all events by letter and bysympathy. The names of such as have reasons foravoiding publicity will be sacredly kept, and ourgrateful expressions conveyed to them by private acknowledgment. Let none who sympathies with us be absent becauseour special invitation may fail to reach them,for accident and omission, however carefully guardedagainst, are almost unavoidable in issuing invitationson so large a scale: and the occasion is one that will,we trust, bring to our acquaintance many now unknownto us, whose co-operation will be most valuable. We entreat any whose love of the cause inducesthem to hesitate about making what they account asmall subscription, to remember that while the largestsum is small in comparison with the grandeur of theCause. the smallest may be the expression of highfeeling, high thinking, and self-sacrifice.
