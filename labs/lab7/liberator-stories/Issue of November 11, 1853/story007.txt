 THE LONDON ANTI-SLAVERY ADVOCATE. for October,begins its second year under auspices far moreencouraging, we believe, than those with which itcame into being a year ago. This year has provedit not merely an important and useful auxiliary, buta necessity of our cause in Great Britain. No measurecould have been more judicious in its conception,or opportune in its execution, than the establishmentof the Advocate. The wisdom of thatscheme, and the fidelity and skill with which it hasbeen accomplished, are put beyond all question bythe journal itself during its first year. It hasbreathed a new life into the anti-slavery movementin England. It has been a new medium of the twocontinents, and the means of concentrating andguiding to practical results a vast amount of anti-slaveryfeeling and sentiment, which before rarely,if ever, found an expressions in fitting action. TheAdvocate has been conducted with signal ability anddiscretion. It has combined unswerving adherenceto principle and boldness of speech with true dignityand courtesy of manner, commending all sinceredevotion to the oppressed with unstated praiseand exposing fair-faced hypocrisies and noisy pretensions with an unsparing hand. We rejoice tolearn that its character and labors are finding theirtrue appreciation, and its circulation and influenceare widening more and more among the friends ofthe slave in Great Britain; and we trust that,while one human being wears the fetters of theslave, its clear light will never wane, nor its manlyvoice be hushed.
