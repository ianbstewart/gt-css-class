 LITTLE EVA. This exceedingly pretty part inthe drama of Uncle Tom's Cabin. which has beenperformed for almost a hundred nights at the NationalTheatre in this city, is proprietor of the TroyMuseum, where she was trained to the stage. Shewas born in Providence, R.I., in the spring of1848; hence it must be admitted that she is somewhatof a prodigy for one so young. We have nofault to find with any of the other characters, andintend no reflection upon them when we say thatthis little girl in the life and soul of the play. Sheis not Cordelier Howard on the stage: she is 'LittleEva,' in life and death. No one can see her inthis part without loving her, and feeling that hisown nature is improved after witnessing her performanceof the character. We learn thatshe will sing a new song next week, composed byher father, who is also the author of 'Little Evain Heaven,' and the hymn sung by Uncle Tom,—The trait we mentioned last week in her characteris a noble one, devoting a dollar of her salary everynight to the relief of the poor little girls of MrPease's school.—Tribune.
