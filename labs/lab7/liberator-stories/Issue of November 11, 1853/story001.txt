 THE U.S. CONSTITUTION IS 'A COVENANT WITH DEATHAND AN AGREEMENT WITH HELL.' ☞ 'Yes! it cannot be divided—the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of theirassent to the Constitution, three special provision TOSECURE THE PERPETUTIY OF THEIR DOMINION OVER THEIRSLAVES. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African slave trade; the second wasTHE STIPULATION TO SURRENDER FUGITIVE SLAVES—anengagement positively prohibited by the laws of God,delivered from Sinai; and, thirdly, the exaction, fatalto the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor SLAVES—for articles of merchandize, underthe name of persons... in fact, the oppressor representingthe oppressed!.. To call government thus constituteda democracy, is to insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slavery. It reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of the nation is to establish an artificialmajority in the slave representative over that of thefree people, in the American Congress; AND THEREBYTO MAKE THE PRESERVATION, PROPAGATION AND PERPEUTATIONOF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANIMATING SPIRITOF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.'—-John Quincy Adams.
