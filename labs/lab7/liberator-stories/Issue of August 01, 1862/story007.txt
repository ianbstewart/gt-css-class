 WIMCHESTER, Va., July 14, 1862. IMCHESTER It is an unaccountable fact that our Union officersare very much inclined to favor the Secesh. Manyof them board in rebel families, and some of thesenot of the most respectable. I state the followingon authority ready to be produced, if officially required.An officer of the Twenty-ninth Pennsylvaniaregiment, lately in command, gave a pass totwo well-known rebel ladies, who loudly declaredthey would stay in Winchester ten years before theywould go under the description of "true and loyalcitizens of the United States." The officer promptlyerased these words, substantially constitutingthese women spies in the rebel service, with authorityto cross our lines. He got small thanks form them,for they laughed at him, and called him a feel assoon as they were cut of his presence. I don't knowthat it can be of any service for a Union man towrite you these facts. There is a special courtesy extended to the rebelwounded and their nurses. Fremont's men, whowere much exhausted by their severe mountainmarch and brave fighting on half rations, have comehere to recruit in considerable numbers. They occupyunfurnished rooms and a church, lying on thehere floor, while sound rebel men nurses are sleepingon the beds gratuitously furnished by benevolentpeople from the North. Why the rebel woundedand sick are not quartered on rebel citizens may bea mystery to you, but it is not to us, seeing that officerswearing the United States uniform are comfortablydomiciled, bedded and befooled by thesesame citizens.â€”Correspondence of the New YorkEvening Post.
