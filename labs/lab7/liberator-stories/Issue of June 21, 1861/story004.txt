 To be conquered in open and manly fight by anation of gentlemen, and subjected to their sway,might not drive us raving distracted with rage andshame; but for Yankees—the most contemptibleand detestable of God's creation—the vile wretches,whose daily sustenance consists in the refuse of allother people—for they eat nothing that anybodyelse will buy—for them to lord it over as—the Englishlanguage must be enlarged, new words must beinvented, to express the extent and depth of ourfeelings of mortification and shame. No, it is notpossible that we can be reduced to a state whichthere are no words to describe. Instead of this, wemust bring these enfranchised slaves back to theirtrue condition. They have long, very properly,looked upon themselves as our social inferiors—asour serfs; their mean, niggardly lives—their low,vulgar, and sordid occupations, have ground thisconviction into them. But, of a sudden, they havecone to imagine that their numerical strength givesthem power—and they have burst the bonds ofservitude, and are running riot with more than thebrutal passions of a liberated wild beast. Their uprisinghas all the characteristics of a ferocious, servileinsurrection. Their first aim is demolition—thedestruction of everything which has the appearanceof superior virtue, which excites their envy andhate, and which, by contrast, exposes the shamefuldeformity of their own lives. They have suggestedto the invention of their territory and the robberof their banks and jewelry stores. We may profitby the suggestion, so far as the invasion goes—forthat will enable as to restore themto their normalcondition of vassalage, and teach them that cap-in-handis the proper attitude of the servant beforehis master. A cock for a sailor, a goose for a soldier—a Yankee for a gentleman—images incongruousand unnatural!!!—Richmond Whig. Richmond Whig.
