 ☞ "What order of men under the most absolute ofmonarchies, or the most aristocratif of republics, was everinvested with such an odious and unjust privilege as thatof the separate and exclusive representation of less thanhalf a million owners of slaves, in the Hall of this Kansasin the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential mansion?This investment of power in the owners of onespecies of property concentrated in the higher authoritiesof the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of thetwenty-six States of the Union, constitutes a privilegedorder of man in the community, more adverse to the rightsof all, and more pernicious to the interests of the whole,than any order of mobility ever known. To call governmentthus constituted a Democracy is to insult the understandingof mankind. . . . It is doubly tainted with theinfection of riches and of slavery. There is no name tothe language of national jurisprudence that can define it—me model in the records of ancient history, or in the politicaltheories of Aristotle, with which it can be likened. Itwas introduced into the Constitution of the Untied Statesby an equivocation—a representation of property under thename of persons. Little did the members of the Conventionfrom the Free States imagine or forsee what a sacrificeto Moloch was hidden under the mask of this concession."—JOHN QUINCY ADAMS. OHN UINCY DAMS.
