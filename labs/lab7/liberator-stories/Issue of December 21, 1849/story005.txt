 'THE NORTH STAR.'—We have received a paperentitled 'The North Star,' published in Rochester,New York, by one John Dick, and edited by oneFrederick Douglass. Who John Dick is, whetherwhite or black, we know not. Douglass is a runawaynegro. We advise him to keep his 'NorthStar' in his breeches' pockets, or confine its benefitsto those benighted latitudes which prefer black starsto bright ones.—Richmond Republican. HE ORTH TAR.
