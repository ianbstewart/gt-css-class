 The 'Anniversaries,' as the week draws near to aclose, go on much more spiritedly that they did duringthe first two or three days. So far, we haveKept our readers pretty well posted up with the interestingdoings of such of our really philanthropicand religious societies as the public take, or aresupposed to take, any real interest in; omitting forthe most part the rabid incoherencies of the anti-slaveryites,under the lead of Garrison, Phillips, AbbyKelley Foster, and others of that ilk. First, becausewe have on hand other matters, of much more generalimportance, which claim precedence in the columnsof the Express; and second, because we areby no means sanguine that a tithe of our readerswould take the trouble to peruse, what of these delectabledoing, a contrary conviction might persuadeus to print. However, if there be any of our friendsfurious enough to know what is now saying anddoing, and ranting, at the Tabernacle, they will findIt all faithfully reported in the Express for the secondweek of May, 1848. The same speeches thatwere made then, about a 'dissolution of the Union,'the same blackguardism of the Christian Church,North and South, and nearly about the same unbridledinvective against the good men of all sectionsof the Union, now literally repeating over again, andrepeated now so often that they have not even thelittle merit of novelty they once possessed. Theclergy, the government, State and national; our variouspolitical and philanthropic institutions, no matterhow sacred, or bow respectedâ€”every thing andevery body, in fact, upon which they can vomit theirribaldry, are damned and denounced in terms thatwould better become the spirits of darkness thanmen claiming to be rational human beings. ranting These yearly fulminations of wrath and bitterness,however, are not without their uses, as we have oftenbefore remarked. Our New York Tabernacle isthe safety-valve, through which escape all the radicalismand disunion which a misguided philanthropyhere, and in some of the Eastern States, contrives togenerate in the course of a twelvemonth. Were somuch Billingsgate and petty treason kept corked upLight, and not allowed free egress, it might gatherstrength enough in process or time (using a homelyphrase) to burst the bottle, and bring upon ourbeads a disaster which can never happen, so long aswe allow it to blow off steam as long and as loud asit likes.
