 Scarcely had this great man taken his lodgings atthe Adams House, in Boston, when Wm. LloydGarrison, one of the high priests of abolitionists, independentlyobtruded himself, with letters of invitationsfrom the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society forhim to be present and operate at as abolitionmeeting. The good man, with characteristic goodsense, immediately detected the trick, and told theofficious meddler that, for himself, he had enough todo be mind his own business, without interferingwith matters in America which did not concern himor his mission. Thus repulsed, Garrison said tohimâ€”'The abolitionists have no wish to divert youfrom the great  which you have come toAmerica to proceeds; on the contrary, they feel adeep and lively interest in that mission, and desirethat your efforts may be crowned with abundant cess.But they trust that, while you are in the country,you will occasionally find an opportunity, both inpublic and in private, to admonish your countrymen tobe true to liberty, and to give us countenance to slaveryor its abutters; for there to great mind of suchcounsel, as they are giving the bright of their religiousand political influence to the side of the slavepower. They hold the day of the on the balance of political power is in their hands.'Here was a mean, succeeding effort to involve for and nefarious purposes, the popularity and influenceof the beloved stranger, which, as a philanthropistand a Christian priest, he so deservedly enjoy.As a  priest, he is called upon tomet opportunities, both public and private, to and influence the Irish of this countryto ally themselves with abolitioars to and  the rights of the South; For entire, theyhave met with a for whose and manly  have been proudagainst their useful ained  to his  of  and language, 'findings protracting the interview deeply  by the result.'   But they trust that, while you are in the country,you will occasionally find an opportunity, both inpublic and in private, to admonish your countrymen tobe true to liberty, and to give us countenance to slaveryor its abutters; for there to great mind of suchcounsel, as they are giving the bright of their religiousand political influence to the side of the slavepower. They hold the day of the on the balance of political power is in their hands.'
