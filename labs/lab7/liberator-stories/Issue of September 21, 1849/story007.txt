 The notorious Wm. Lloyd Garrison, in his exclusiveattachment to the d side of philanthropy,has been doing his best to 'corner,' if not paralyze,Father Mathew in his bet purposes with regardto the Irish in America. It is abominable thata man, unexceptionable as a Christian, a divine, anda gentlemen, cannot land upon our shores, but thedogs of intolerance and fanaticism are immediatelyset at his heels, if possible to turn him from thepath of his peculiar utility. Cannot those people do-goodin their own way, without turning to bitter-acesthose fruits of endeavor which may not comeunder their immediate control? Have these Boston'puros' no sense of the courtesy which is due toa stranger—one only anxious to escape controversyin order to devote himself to what he knows will bepractically beneficial? The letter which we appendwill show that the wretched selfishness of a fewleading abolitionists may probably embitter the remainderof Father Mathew's stay in America. Itwill show that these men recognize but one evil inChristendom, and that is slavery. Why shouldFather Mathew visit the South to reform the drunkenwhites, when he might instruct the blacks howto cut their throats ing a debauch? Why shoulda messenger of peace presume to visit our shores,unless consenting to travel the sectarian track dictatedto him? Garrison and his brethren wouldfain have tied the feet of the  of temperance,and now, finding him true to his mission—to his holy,single-hearted purpose—they, with a malignantchuckle, publish what they conceive to be their triumph.Thank heaven, there is sense and rationalityextent, and Father Mathew may survive. d
