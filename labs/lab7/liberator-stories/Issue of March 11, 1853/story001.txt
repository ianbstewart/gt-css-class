 General Meeting of the Massachusetts A.S. Society,Wednesday Evening, Jan. 26, 1853. General Meeting of the Massachusetts A.S. Society,Wednesday Evening, Jan. 26, 1853. GRAPHICALLY REPORTED BY J.M.W. YERRINTON.  PARKER PILLSBURY, from the Business Committee, the following resolutions:— ARKER ILLSBURY  Resolved. That the anti-slavery enterprise is more a crusade, moral or political, against slavery-ex,by purchase of territory, or by seizing it in of conquest:—it is more than a vindication of the of speech, of the press, or of locomotion;—it is than a controversy about the constitutionality offugitive Slave Laws, or the writ of habeas corpus, ora right of jury trial for fugitive slaves;—it is an direct, exterminating and everlasting warfare the doctrine, that man ever, under any possible circumstances, can be made the goodsof chattels of his fellow-man.          That, however much we may rejoice in charge of public sentiment as it appears in the the part of the people to execute the FugitiveSlave Law in so many places in the North, or to visit its on those who resist it, even though they take of the kidnapper; and as also appears in the to nominate for the Presidency those who hadbeen most active in securing its passage; and as further in the occasional triumphs of the Free Soil; still we must never forget that all these are but results and fundamental principles, and that is is only thus faithful that we can hope to witness greater results, and the final emancipation of everyslave.           Mr. PILLSBURY then proceeded to speak upon the as follows:— ILLSBURY  Mr. PRESIDENT,—I think there is one mistake in the of many who profess to be friends of the slave; that mistake is, in relation to the origin and sourceof the evil of slavery. And if we can by some means at a just conclusion as to the real source of the there can be little doubt but that we will find wisdomand fidelity enough in some quarter to resist andoverthrow it. RESIDENT     It is very common opinion, that slavery is the creatureof law: that it is the result of a defect in our Constitution;but all this is a mistake—a mere fancifullie.  Slavery is not the 'creature of law,' and does its origin to any defect in the Constitution.Slavery is a plant of spontaneous growth, in just such as is that among the American people. Slaverygrows out of that soil as naturally as weeds from a dunghill. It grows because it cannothelp growing. It is a spontaneous production, andnever supposes it can be overthrown'—the soil and remaining as they have been in times past—hasvery little idea, it seems to me, of true moral agriculturalSlavery exists in our land, because we have gotjust that state of moral sentiment which produces it,—and whatever supposes that, by political action, or by change of Constitution, or by resolutions of ecclesiasticalor other bodies, the evil will be overthrown, the moral sentiment of the country remains as it,  entertains a childish fancy. Slavery springs up vegetation from the stagnant pools and, under the moral and religious tillage of thousand ordained and consecrated gardeners, to have the oversight of God's spiritual herUnless there can be a change in this domestic, unless there can be a very radical change in themselves, and in the implements ofher husbandry, there is no probability that, under suchtime, there will be any great change in the crop; for be the same, and only the same, and that con.                  of the resolutions which I have read describes what anti-slavery is not. I think we have seen, in few years the correctness of the principle unin that resolution. We have a political anti-slaveryparty. It begin many years ago, and began, in respects, very honorably indeed. It was descendedfrom men and from women who were many of them with the spirit of Freedom; and the original of that political party did not differ material the sentiments of the American and Mass. A.. They demanded the immediate, unconditionalemancipation of every slave, without colonizationand without expatriation of any kind and without to the master. That was the original de.On such a basis was the Free Soil, or Free, or Liberty party originally formed. But political associations, it will be found, that whatof love for truth and freedom there is in them, it declines, till it is swallowed up in a reckless for party success. Just in proportion as a politicalparty gathers numerical strength, just in that prodoes it contract disease and weakness. You how the party commenced, any you know to has come at last. You know who were its canJAMES G. BIRNEY—a repentant slaveholder; who had sacrificed all things in the cause of liberty,who had been content to be regarded as the offof all flesh, to lose his position in society, his and profitable place in the government of his, his standing in the highest social circles of—all these he had sacrificed. Then he had a press, and consecrated it to the doctrines of and personal liberty. That was sacrificed by a brutal and infuriated mob; it was into the Ohio river; but still the noble editor unabashed and unterrified in the midst of this of persecution and infuriated rage. But the gathered numerical strength, until at length it to be like the children of Israel when they dea king, that might be like the nations them. Mr. Briney began to suffer in the popu on account of his fidelity. By and by sacraficed, and another candidate was substitute not remarkable for devotion to liberty, either in time past, or in the time then present. With Mr. P. Hale, the numerical strength increased; but moral force declined, until it drooped and descended to that paragon of pro-slavery and political Martin Van Buren. There, for the present,  it.                     AMES IRNEY                          All these changes we have witnessed to that party.The history only confirms my position, that just as politicalparties gather numerical strength, just in thatproportion will decline their power to accomplish anygreat or good result. What is true of parties is equally true of individuals;and we have seen, in our own midst, the sacrifice ofsome of the brightest luminaries our country has furnished—sacrificedby their elevation to office. I refer,now, particularly to the position of the distinguishedFree Soil Senator from Massachusetts—a man who wasonce known in both hemispheres as a zealous and uncompromisingchampion of universal freedom; whohad not only learned but taught what is 'The TrueGrandeur of Nations'; but a man, too, who, in consequenceof his success, in consequence of his havingbeen elevated to a place of honor and profit, has beensacrificed on the same altar upon which have been placedso many illustrious victims before him. Men talkabout the fall of Daniel Webster, and they seem to deploreit I regard the fall of Charles Sumner asequally real, and ten thousand times more dreadful.The one fell as falls the withered and thunder-scarredoak, that has braved the tempest of century after century—thathas been bereft of its beauty and its blossoms—thathas been shorn and shivered, and left awithered though mighty monument of the power of theelements, and finally yielded, and fallen ignominiouslyto the earth. The other was smitten like the mountainpine, in all its vigor and in all Hs beauty. Slaveryscathed it to death with a single bolt of its lightning.One terrible glance from its Gorgon eye has witheredhim, until his fall is, as I have said, as real, and tenthousand times more dreadful, than the tall of DanielWebster. The TrueGrandeur of Nations I know this may seem a somewhat extravagant position;but it is a position which should be taken, if itis one which can be defended. The time has come whenthe whole truth should be spoken, as well as nothingbut the truth. CHARLES SUMMER was one thing as aprivate gentleman in the city of Boston; but I appealto this audience if be were not quite another thing as aSenator from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?Before he was nominated, before he was thought of asa candidate, he could make the walls of the old 'Cradleof Liberty' to ring with his eloquence, while hedenounced that infamous enactment, the Fugitive SlaveLaw. Hear him:— whole HARLES UMMER 'The soul sickens in the contemplation of this legalizedoutrage. In the dreary annals of the Past, thereare many acts of shame—there are ordinances of monarchs,and laws, which have become a by-word and ahissing to the nations. But, when we consider thecountry and the age, I ask fearlessly, What act of shame,what ordinance of monarch, what law, can compare inatrocity with this enactment of an American Congress?['None!'] I do not forget Appius Clandins, the tyrantdecimvir of ancient Rome, condemning Virginia as aslave; nor Louis XIV. of France, letting slip the dogsof religious persecution by the revocation of the edictof Nantes; nor Charles I. of England, arousing thepatriot rage of Hampden by the extortion of ship-money;nor the British Parliament, provoking, in ourown country, spirits kindred to Hampden, by the tyrannyof the Stamp Act and Tea Tax. I would not exaggerate;I wish to keep within hounds; but I thinkno person can doubt that the condemnation now affixedto all these transactions, and to their authors, must bethe lot hereafter of the Fugitive Slave Bill, and of everyone, according to the measure of his influence, whogave it his support. [Three cheers were here given.]Into the immortal catalogue of national crimes this hasnow past, drawing with it, by an inexorable necessity,its authors also; and chiefly him, who, as President ofthe United States, set his name to the Bill, and breathedinto it that final breath, without which it would haveno life. [Sensation.] Other Presidents may be forgotten;but the name signed to the Fugitive Slave Billcan never be forgotten. ['Never!'] There are depthsof infamy, as there are heights of fame. [Applause,]I regret to say what I must; hut truth compels me.Better far for him had ho never been born. [Renewedapplause.]' when we consider thecountry and the age That was Charles Sumner before has was nominatedfor Senator—before he was thought of for that highoffice; and in the same address, a little further on, inreference to the kidnapper, and the manner in which beshould be treated, when discovered prowling among us,be boldly and nobly says:— 'But it rests with you, my fellow-citizens, by yourwords and your example, by your calm determinationsand your devoted lives, to do this work. From a humane,just and righteous people, shall spring a Public Opinion,to keep perpetual guard over the liberties of all withinour borders. Nay, more, like the flaming sword of thecherubim at the gates of Paradise, turning on everyside, it shall prevent any SLAVE-HUNTER from eversetting foot on this Commonwealth. (Cheers redoubled.)Elsewhere, he may pursue his human prey; he mayemploy his congenial blood-hounds, and exult in hissuccessful game; but into Massachusetts he must notcome. (Immense enthusiasm.) And yet again I say,I counsel no violence. I would not touch his person.Not with whips and though would I scourge him fromthe land. The contempt, the indignation, the abhorrenceof the community shall be our weapons of offense.Wherever ho moves, he shall find no house to receiveHim—no table spread to nourish him—no welcome tocheer him. The dismal lot of the Roman exile shall behis. He shell be a wanderer, without roof, fire or muter.(Laughter.) Men shall paint at him in thestreets, and on the highways: roof, fire or muter. 'Sleep shall neither night nor dayHang upon his pent-house lid;He shall live a man forbid.Weary seven nights, nine times nine,Shall he dwindle, peak and pine.'     (Applause.) The village, towns and cities shall refuse to receivethe monster; they shall vomit him forth, never againto disturb the repose of our community. (Repeatedrounds of applause.)' I wish to call your attention to the parts of theaddress I have just read. In the first part, he refers tothe President of the United States, without whose sanctionand signature the Fugitive Slave Law could haveand so life. In the other, he speaks of the manner inwhich Massachusetts should receive the kidnapper. Onhis own showing. I think Mr. Fillmore is slave-hunterand kidnapper-in-chief—is be not?—because it was he(and he only) who could give that breath of life to theFugitive Slave Law, without which it would have no offset.Mr. Sanmer speaks of this manner in which theseMen are to be received:—' The villages, towns and citiesShall refuse to receive the monster, and shall vomithim forth, never again be disturb the repose of a peacefulcommunity.' Yet when Mr. Fillmore cause on toBoston, soon after, who was among the very first to visithim, and extend to him the courtesies of the city of Boston,and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, but thatsame Charles Summer; the same who declared thatthe 'villages, towns and cities should refuse to receivethe monster, and should vomit him forth, never again todisturb the repose of a peaceful community'? Bostondid not do it! I think it will be necessary, before sheis thus sick of him, at her stomach, for us to administera somewhat stronger emetic. But I wish to speak more particularly of the positionof the Senator of Massachusetts as a member of the Congressof the United States. It is through that we are tolook for the fruits—for the ripe and improved fruitsof Free Soil—of political anti-slavery cultivation. Justafter his election—in his letter to the Legislature acceptinghis appointment, he says— fruits 'I accept the appointment as the servant of theUnion; bound to study and maintain, with equal patrioticcare, the interests of all parts of our country; todiscountenance every effort to loosen any of those tiesby which our fellowship of States is held in fraternalcompany; and to oppose all sectionalism, whether itappear in unconstitutional efforts by the North to carryso great a boon as Freedom into the Slave States, orin unconstitutional efforts by the South, aided byNorthern allies, to the sectional evil of slaveryinto the free States.' sectionalism carryso great a boon as Freedom into the Slave States sectional While the election was yet pending, the language of theFree Boilers was, 'If you win stand still, and see thesalvation of God, we will put Charles Sumner into theCongress of the United States.' Well, we stood still,and we saw the election;—we saw, also, the fugitiveslave Sims sent back to slavery—I will not stop, I darenot stop to consider what relation one transaction bore tothe other. 'I accept the appointment,' says the newlyelected Senator, 'as the servant of the Union.' At thattime, what was Daniel Webster doing?' He was on a pilgrimage,devout as Peter the Hermit, saving the Union.He was travelling from Washington to Dunkirk, andthence to Buffalo, and back through Rochester, Syracuse,Albany, and elsewhere, saving the Union, fancyinghis own the only name under heaven given amongmen whereby it could be saved. Mr. Sumner, before hewas nominated, could write a letter, in which he said,'Strongly attached as I am to the Union, I Would notsacrifice one jot or little of our principles to its conservation.Union is precious, but Freedom, Humanity,Religion, are more precious still. It were poor indeedto save the Union by a damning blot upon the nationalconscience, which no time could efface.' saving the Union. saving the Union Now he can say—(pardon me for so much reading,)now he can say, 'I accept the appointment as the servantof the Union; bound to study and maintain,with equal patriotic cure, the interests of all partsof our country; to discountenance every effort toloosen any of those ties by which our fellowship ofStates is held in fraternal company; and to oppose allsectionalism, whether it appear in unconstitutional effortsby the North to carry so great a boon as freedominto the slave States, or in unconstitutional efforts bythe South, aided by Northern allies, to carry the sectionalevil of slavery into the free States.' And again—'With me, the Union is twice-blessed; first, as thepowerful guardian of the repose and happiness of thirty-onesovereign States, clasped by the endearing name ofcountry, and next, as the model and beginning of thatall-embracing federation of States, by which unity,peace and concord will finally be organized among thenations.' Further on, he says—' If I decline to recognizeas my guides any of the men of to-day, I shallfeel safe, while I follow the master-principles which theUnion was established to secure, and lean for support onthat great triumvirate of American freedom, WASHINGTON,FRANKLIN, and JEFFERSON.' sectional ASHINGTON RANKLIN EFFERSON. Mr. Sumner declines to receive as his guide, any ofthe 'men of the day,' but leans rather for support onthose two names from 'that great triumvirate of Americanfreedom,' Thomas Jefferson and George Washington—theone a slaveholder, living and dying, the othernot only a slaveholder, but a slave-hunter!! and thesigner and executor-in-chief, as President, of one of thevilest Fugitive Slave Laws that were ever enacted underheaven. These were the 'guides' which Mr. Sumnerplaced before his eyes! slave-hunter!! But I leave all that. He went, in due time, to Washington.We expected then to see a manifestation of thepower and efficiency of political anti-slavery action tooverthrow the evils of slavery. We waited patiently andlong; but in the fulness of time,, it was the fullness, hisfirst essay at the overthrow of slavery made Hs appearance—andafter eight or nine months of silence, he gaveutterance to his sentiments. Now, it seems to me,—though the remark may seem somewhat startling,—thatthe influence of the speech of Daniel Webster, on theSeventh of March, 1850, was of no consequence whatever,in comparison with the disastrous and fatal effectof this first and hitherto last speech of Charles Summer. in the fulness of time, fullness Mr. Chairman: Do you knew whether any man,North or South, our went so far as to call slaveholdersand slave-hungers 'DEMI-GODS,' in distinction from commonmen! I have already adverted to the fact, thatGen. Washington was not only a slaveholder and slave-hunter,smelling his gene away to the bleak hills ofNew Hampshire, but that he signed the first FugitiveSlave Law of which, till recently, I had any knowledge.And yet, when Charles Sumner alludes to that man, andto Jefferson, common language does not subserve hispurpose; he mounts into the height of the high heroic,and proclaims that slaveholder and slave-hunter—notonly, as at first, one of the 'great triumvirate ofAmerican freedom,' the first person in his patriot andPolitical trinity—but now he proclaims him a Deity—and even more, as the 'REVERED demi-god,' before whenall nations should bow down with wonder and worship.If you know, Mr. Chairman, of any other man who hasThus exalted a man-hunter, a kidnapper, as well asSlave-breeder and slaveholder, I confuse that you haveread history to better purpose than I. I think it hasremained for this most illustrious Senator of the FreeSoil party to pronounce a eulogy on such a man, thathas no parallel, even from the blasphemous, the unhallowedlips of Daniel Webster himself. But in regard to the speech of Senator Sumner, sufferme a little farther. If I do not greatly misapprehend,very many of the friends of the slave whollymisunderstand it; wholly fail in comprehending it. Ido think its morality in same parts, is as deadly as isthe morality of the speech of the 7th of March, 1850.It seems to me it makes no advance, whatever, on thegenerally received doctrines of these slaveholders, slave-breedersand slave-catchers, who laid foundationsof our government; and that all it proposes to do, is togo back and stand where they stood, and constitute ourselves,as they did, a nation of tyrannical hypocrites,or hypercritical tyrants, who could fight the battle offreedom for themselves, and then go home and grewrich, by stealing and calling the children of their poorneighbor. It has been said of General Washington,that he refused any compensation for his eight years'service in the cause of the country. Well he might;for bow many meat and women were laboring underlash of the task-master all that time, and before andafterward, (God remembers how long,) that he mighthave the means of living, and be able to fight hiscountry's battles? No glory has ever covered their names;no honor has ever been paid to their memory; no pensionsawarded; no monument commemorates their dismaltoil;—and yet, while be was reaping a harvest ofhonor, fame, and immortality on the field of battle, andwhile our nation has not yet ceased praising him for his'disinterested' devotion, hundreds of his follow-men,as good as himself, and to whom liberty was as dear,were toiling from one year to another,—from the cradleto the grave,—from their cradles to their coffinlessgraves,—that a he might have the wealth which wouldenable him to serve his country without compensation!O yes, Washington was rich—he needed nothing; butwhose stripes made him so? 'disinterested' It has been claimed for this speech of Mr. Sumner,—ofwhich forty thousand copies were circulated duringthe last Presidential campaign,—that it denies utterlythe constitutionality of the slave system, and proves itsunconstitutionality. It enumerates the pro-slaveryclauses of the Constitution instead. It numbers them,like the figures on a carpenter's rule; and yet, manyof his blind devotees utterly deny, with the most remarkabletenacity, that there is a word in speech favoringthe constitutionality of the slave system of thiscountry. But let this pass, for it was not to this part of theaddress I wanted to refer. A word mere in regard toGeorge Washington—for Mr. Sumner says he declinesto accept as his guides the lights of to-day, but turns tothe luminaries of the past, and follows the illustriousexample set him by this first person in his great Trinityof American Freedom. Now what was the character of the law of 1798? Ifthere be any thing of argument in the speech of Mr.Sumner, it is as strong against the law of 1796 asagainst that of 1850. I would like to appeal to any ofMr. Sumner's friends who are present, if it he not so?—ifnearly every word against the law of '50 does notweigh with equal force against the law of '98? Yet his'revered demigod,' Washington, signed the law Of '93,'without which it would have had no life,' and engaged ina hunt after a slave woman all the way to New-Hampshire! without which it would have had no life And here, Mr. Chairman, is a little extract fromthe letter of Gen. Washington to the collector of Portsmouth,Mr. Whipple, to whom he applied for the recoveryof his fugitive slave. Collectors in those times,it seems, collected something besides revenue, now andthen. After giving a description of the woman, hesays;— collected 'I do not mean, however, by this request, that suchviolent measures should be used as would excite a MOBor a Riot, which might be the ease, if she has ADHERENTS;or even uneasy sensations in the minds of well-disposedcitizens. Rather than either of these shouldhappen, I would forego her services altogether; and theexample, also, which is of infinitely more importance.' and theexample, also, which is of infinitely more importance.' Now, what does Charles Sumner counsel in his speechin Faneuil Hall? What kind of resistance does hepropose? He says he will counsel no violence; but yet,you will bear me witness, if in that bold and manlyspeech, he does not counsel the protection of the slaveat all hazards; and if he would not admire the exaltedheroism displayed in the rescue of Shadrach in Boston,and the deliverance of Jerry at Syracuse. Butsuppose the attempt had been made to arrest this slavewoman at Portsmouth, and some of her friends had ralliedand rescued her, what does Mr. Sumner's 'revereddemigod' call them who should make it? Why, hesays—' I do not mean, however, by this request, thatsuch violent measures should be used as would excite aMOB or RIOT.'!! I believe, then, that those who rescue,or those who save the slave from re-capture, whether itbe under the law of '98 or '50, are pronounced a'MOB or a RIOT'!! It strikes me that we are notsufficiently impressed with the strange morality of thisdocument, coming as it does from so illustrious a sourceas Gen. Washington, and then appealed to, in our owntimes, by a no less illustrious man than the Free SoilSenator from Massachusetts. 'I do act mean, however,by this request, that such violent measures shouldbe used as would excite a mob or riot, which might bethe case if she has adherents, or even uneasy sensationsin the minds of well-disposed citizens.' Who are they—those 'well-disposed citizens,? I suppose they arethose law-abiding men of Milk and State streets—thesewho 'obey a law, while it is a law'! 'Rather thanthat either of these should happen,' continues the writer,'I would forego her serviles altogether; and theexample, also, which is of infinite more importance.'Isn't there magnanimity for you! It seems to me,that you rarely find such sentiments expressed as these.I think there is little, even in Daniel Webster's 7th ofMarch speech, to compare with them. And yet, theseare the sentiments of George Washington, the first personin Mr. Sumner's political trinity,—the 'revereddemi-god' of his devotion and his worship! mob or riot adherents Well, let me just pass along to the commentary ofMr. Sumner on that extract from the letter. He says,'The fugitive never was returned; but lived in freedomto a good old age, down to a very recent period, a monumentof'—what? A monument to the 'mobocracy'that prevailed there? A monument to the humanityof the rioters,' such as snatched Shadrach from thelungs of the destroyer? No! 'She lived in freedomto a good old age, down to a very recent period, amonument of the 'just forbearance' of him whom weaptly call the 'Father of his Country'! You mustremember what I just read from George Washington'sletter. What did he, in his 'just forbearance,' saymust be the condition of her re-capture? Did he say,'Let her be civilly and kindly requested to go back, andif she decline returning, then let her remain—1st her'live in freedom to a good old age,' and Heaven blessand reward her for what also has done for me'? If hehad said this, then there would have been some slightfoundation for the language I just now read. But wasthe poor victim to be commited at all, more than if shewere a dumb beast? On the contrary, did be not brandthese as 'RIOTERS' and 'MONOCRATS' who should seekto rescue her from his clutch? 'just forbearance' live in freedom to a good old age, Now, Mr. Sumner tells us that 'she lived in freedomto a good old age, a monument of the just forbearanceof him whom you aptly call the Rather of his Country'!I know of no instance that is a parallel to this monstrouslogic, except it be in the history of Jesus of Nazareth.'The Scribes and Pharisees sought to put himto death—but they feared the people.' They took upstones to cast at him—'but they feared the people.'They went forth and 'took counsel together how theyshould put him to death'—' but they feared the people.'Three years they hunted him like any kidnappers;'but they feared the people.' So, Jesus of Nazarethlived, according to Mr. Sumner's logic, to goodold ago—at least, he lived a time—'a monument to thejust forbearance' of the Scribes and Pharisees:—(Laughter and cheers.) a monument to thejust forbearance If I do injustice, in the position I take, to Gen.Washington, or to Mr. Senator Sumner, let the injusticebe pointed out. He says, 'she lived a monumentof the just forbearance of him whom we aptly call theFather of hit Country.' But yet, it was only the fearof a mob or a riot, that prevented him from snatchinghis victim at all hazards, and hurrying her back to thedeep perdition from which she had escaped, to weep andwail away the rest of her existence. But let us go a little further. 'It is true,' continuesMr. Sumner, 'that he sought her return. This wemust regret, and find its apology.' Indeed! 'Find itsapology'! It seems to too, the Free Soil party mightbe better employed than in electing Senators to 'findapology' for kidnappers, in high or low life. Why,they could have employed ministers to do the work forhalf the money it costs to pay Charles Sumner. Bostonhas got a multitude of such ministers, who are readyto volunteer, and do volunteer, to apologize for kidnappingand kidnappers! But yet, 'we must find an apology,'he says, for Washington seeking to re-capturethat slave—and that slave, a mother! I did not knowthat it was necessary to find any apology. 'This wemust regret, and find its apology.' . . . . 'From thisact of Washington, still swayed by the policy of theworld, I appeal to Washington writing his will.' Andwhat was Washington writing his will? That documentprovided that all the slaves he had, should live and dieslaves, if he happen to outlive them; and that everychild should drink the terrible sacrament of sweating,sorrow and anguish which the fathers and mothers haddrunk, if he or his widow should happen to outlivethem! (What if he had lived as long, perhaps, asDaniel Webster is going to live? You know he said,anticipating futurity,' I still live!') Suppose Washingtondid say his slaves, having served him and hiswife while they lived, should, at their death—they havingno children to whom to bequeath them—be set free?Why, in Heaven's name, might they not be set freethen? When there was nobody to inherit them, andthe owner could use them no more, what was there ofmagnanimity in setting them free? 'From this act ofWashington, still swayed by the policy of the world,'says Mr, Sumner, 'I appeal to Washington writing hiswill. From Washington on earth, I appeal to Washingtonin heaven.' And yet, Washington lived anddied a slaveholder!—lived a slaveholder, and died leavinga will bequeathing his slaves to his only heir, hiswife!—and then 'ascended to heaven'! You remember,when Gorsuch was killed at Christiana, that aleading Methodist journal published a long obituary,proclaiming him the most eminent saint of the day,—alwaysexcepting, of course, Daniel Webster. He wasproclaimed, among other things,' a model Methodist'!and it was represented of him, that he was now walkingthe streets of the New Jerusalem! I saw an oldemancipated slave woman in Ohio, and she spoke,—forshe was once herself a member of the MethodistChurch,—she spoke of her brother Gorsuch, representedto have beat a model Christian, and she said, 'Ifthe like of Gorsuch goes to heaven, I tell you die childwill hire her board in to other place.' If Gen. Washington,after such acts as this, and such sentiments, gotto heaven, why, we might as well not have any otherplace. volunteer we must find an apology a mother! brother 'From Washington on earth,' says Mr. Sumner,! Iappeal to Washington in heaven.' . . . 'His death isabove his life.' I have heard a good deal said before of death-bed repentance;but I never heard it very highly extolled.This is one of the most illustrious instances is which Ihave heard it commended. 'His last testament cancelshis authority as a slaveholder. However he may haveappeared before man, he came into the presence of Godonly as the liberator of his slaves'!! I do not knowhow such a sentiment strikes you, Mr. Chairman, butto my mind, it strikes at the foundation of all morality,and mocks all true religion. It seems to me that itutterly annihilates all moral distinctions, it allowsthe kidnapper and slave-hunter to pursue their prey,and then to plunder them until Death shall come, andproclaim their deliverance. Why may not the pirateon the high seas as well,—why may not the perpetratorof any other crime, no matter how bloody or how black,pursue his unhallowed business as long as life belengthened out, and then just die and go up absolved toheaven, only by virtue of having quitted his plunderwhen he could not hold it longer? only as the liberator of his slaves'!! how bloody or how black Now, Mr. Chairman, are we to suppose that this isthe best the Free Soil party could do? Was it for suchmorality and such devotion, to liberty as this, that wewere requested and urged to suspend our moral agitation,and allow Charles Sumner to be elevated to theSenatorship of the United States? Was it for this thatthe laws of Massachusetts must be triumphed under foot,while poor Sitns was held captive in the Court House,fattening for the slaughter to which he was soon to beled; and that building surrounded with chains, andwith a bristling cordon of police, more hateful thanscorpions?—was it for such morality and such devotionto liberty as this, that all these sacrifices were made,and all this shame endured? I have read the characterof the Whig party to very little purpose, if therecan be found in its speeches any thing more gross, moreprofane, or more blasphemous towards God's law, towardsLiberty, Justice, and true Religion, than is themorality of this—the first and the last speech of theillustrious Free Soft Senator from Massachusetts, beforethe loftiest legislative body of the United States. Mr. Chairman, I will not longer detain the audienceI have taken this opportunity, at the opening of themeeting, to throw out these remarks, in the hope thatthey may cause earnest inquiry, and awaken deeper reflectionon this subject. I trust a course will be takenin this meeting, that shall give it the character whichour meetings have always hitherto been so fortunate asto possess. I am not discouraged that the house is not filled; Iam not discouraged at what some call the apparent coldnesson the part of the friends of humanity. But I willtell you what is to be deplored; and that is, that underthe influence of such sentiments as those that I haveread, very much of this coldness has been produced. It isnot on account of the Seventh of March speech. Thatspeech roused all the humanity and love of liberty inMassachusetts, and wherever else its blasphemies went.But the speech of Charles Sumner in Congress has doneMuch to lay the Spirit of Freedom, in this Common-wealth,low in the dust. The effect of that oration willbe remembered and felt when the effect of Daniel Webster'sspeech shall be forgotten. I have nothing to sayin regard to the motives of the Senator, nor of his constituents.I institute so comparison as to the designsof these two great men; one of whom has just closed along, but sadly inglorious public life, and the other isnow beginning what may be more or less inglorious,according as he himself shall elect.
