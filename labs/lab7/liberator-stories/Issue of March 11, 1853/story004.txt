 FRIEND GARRISON—Miss Stone has given three lecturesIn this place—two on Woman's Rights, and one on slavery. The two on Woman's Rights were very susceptibleattended, considering the attractions elsewhere.The Orthodox church were holding a Fair atthe time, but apparently they could not sustain it,without the assistance of anti-slavery. They had aminister flag of 'Uncle Tom.' That is what I call anoticeable 'sign of the times.' Likewise, the Hutchinsonfamily were here, and gave a concert one eveningof Miss Stone's lecture. However, her second lecturewe well attended. The hall was full, containing aboutfour hundred. On Sunday evening, she held a meetingon slavery, in Liberty Hall, in concert with the Hutchinsonfamily, who contributed their melody on the occasion.There was a fee at the door of one eighth of aDollar, which kept out the stamping clam, and broughtforward from eight to nine hundred (as many as thehall would hold) of our best citizens. RIEND ARRISON Uncle Tom. Miss Stone gave one of the cleared logical discoursesI ever had the pleasure of listening to. The exercisewere as quiet as a Quaker meeting, except once in awhile there would be outbursts of applause at someof her merited home-thrusts. There can be no danger,after this, but that she would command as audiencethat would fill any hail in this city. FREDERICK DOUGLASS was here a week age, and hada large meeting at Liberty Hall. So we have been quiterefushed, lately, with anti-slavery talk. REDERICK OUGLASS
