 THE U.S. CONSTITUTION IS 'A COVENANT WITH DEATHAND AN AGREEMENT WITH HELL.' ☞'Yes! IT CANNOT BE DENIED—the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of theirassent to the Constitution, three special provisions TOSECURE THE PERPETUITY OF THEIR DOMINON OVER THEIRSLAVES. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,Of preserving the African slave trade; the second wasTHE STIPULATION TO SURRENDER FUGITIVE SLAVES—anEngagement positively prohibited by the laws of God,'Delivered from Sinai; and, thirdly, the exaction, fatal,to the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor SLAVES—for article of merchandise, underthe name of persons.....in fact, the oppressor representingthe oppressed!...To call government thus constituted a democracy,is insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slaver. Its reciprocal operation upon thatgovernment of the nation is to establish an artificialmajority in the slave representation over that of thefree people, in the American Congress; AND THERESTTO MAKE THE PRESERVATION, PROPAGATION AND PERFETUATIONOF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND AMIMATION SPIKESOF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.'—John Quincy Adams.
