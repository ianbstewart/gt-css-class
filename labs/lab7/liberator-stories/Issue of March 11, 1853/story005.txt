 ☞The Painesville Church, Presbyterian,has adopted the following resolution: Resolve, That we do now withdraw from the Grand River Presbytery.' From the Ohio Star, we learn that the resolution wasadopted in consequence of the contumacy of the Presbyteryin retaining its connection with slavery, and thatthe seceeders proceeded to organize an independent Presbyterian Church. One step in the right direction. Wehope these brethren will next inquire into their connectionwith and support of slavery through the government,and act with equal decision.—A.S. Bugle. Star A.S.
