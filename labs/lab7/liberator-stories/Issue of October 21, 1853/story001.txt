 THE U.S. CONSTITUTION IN 'A COVENANT WITH DEATHAND AN AGREEMENT WITH NELL.' ☞ 'Yes! IT CANNOT BE DENIED—the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of theirassent to the Constitution, three special provisions TOSECURE THE PERPETUITY OF THEIR DOMINION OVER THEIR SLAVES. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African slave trade; the second wasTHE STIPULATION TO SURRENDER FUGITIVE SLAVES—anengagement positively prohibited by the laws of God,delivered from Sinai; and, thirdly the exaction, fatalto the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor SLAVES—for articles of merchandise underthe name of persons... in fact, the oppressor representingthe oppressed!... To call government thus constituteda democracy, is to insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly talented with the infection ofriches and slavery. Its reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of the nation is to establish an artificial majority in the slave representation over that of thefree people, in the American Congress; AND THEREBYTO MAKE THE PRESERVATION, PROPAGATION AND PERPETUATIONOF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANIMATING SPIRITOF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS.'—John Quincy Adams.
