 ☞Our impression is that the Liverpool Chroniclewas far from being enthusiastic or fanatical,but rather the contrary, in regard to the Duchessof Sutherland's Address, &c. This being the case,the following from that journal is a testimony to beconsidered: Chronicle 'When Mrs. Stowe first reached England, ourfear was that the visit would have been far lessprivate than it has been, and that the occasionwould have been seized to fan into a flame the anti-slaveryfeeling which is so general in this country,which could hardly fail to have alienSted, tosome extent, at least, the kindly sympathy whichnow happily exists between the old and the nowcountry,—between the young giant of the Westand the old connexion at home. But the good tasteof Mrs. Stowe has induced her to decline many ofthe invitations proceed upon her, and she even refusedthe compliment of a public breakfast on themorning of her departure, which the Mayor ofLiverpool was anxious to pay her. In all this, theinstinctive delicacy of a refined and noble nature isvisible. Had Mrs. Stowe been sordid enough to haveviewed her visit with reference solely to pecuniary results,she might have carried back as many dollarsas would have satiated the most boundless avarice;but nobler aspirations have evidently promptedherself and her friends, and, to the respect which herliterary powers command, must now be added thesingleness of purpose which seems to have inspiredher during her four months' sojourn in Europe.—Whateverdifferences of opinion may exist amongsther countrymen respecting slavery as an institution,every American must feel proud in hailing sogifted and unselfish a creature as a native of the United States.'
