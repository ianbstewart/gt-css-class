 BRANDON, Vt., Sept. 30th, 1853. RANDON If you have not seen the good hit by Rev. ByronSanderlin, of Washington, D.C. on a 4th of Julyvisit to Orwell, his native place, (Vt.), I willtranscribe it for your amusement. It is an extemporeeffusion on a festival occasion—in extract: 'And now we might rest, but there's one bit of scandalAgainst Uncle Sam, which his enemies handle;They say he's diseased with a black-headed cancer,And to cover it up, they insist will not answer;That some of his girls that raise sugar and cotton,From the self-same disorder, are fast growing rotten.Mrs. Stowe in her book says the black spot is slavery,Upheld and prolonged by political knavery;And for this Madame England has invited here ever,To feast on good things, like a pig in the clover,Now, of course, we all know, without any teacher,Hattie Stowe's a smart woman, because she's a Beacher,And its right for the Stafford House folks to fly at her,And fondle and toast her, and pet her and put her;But we must not forget, in the midst of the bubble,How Uncle Sam came at first by this trouble:'Tis true, the mark's on him, and pesters him badly,And when the right time comes, he'll part with itgladly;But let them remember, these Stafford House weasels,This same mother England has caught the black measels;She's spotted the child while in that situation,And now she turns round and vents her indignation.But it's hoped he'll be patient, and firm and enduring,And that upon he will most with an actual curing.The prescription we make is to purge out the nation,By a through emetic of colonization;Far better than all your Congressional nursing,Than the spit-fire and spite of fanatical cursing;Than your snobs of reform, your humbug an quackery,If you don't believe this, you may ask Mr. Thackeray.'           all             her         pretty good. The Abolitionists at the festivalwere too lucicrously attached to be angry, andthey could only join in the laugh.—Journal ofCommerce. Journal ofCommerce.
