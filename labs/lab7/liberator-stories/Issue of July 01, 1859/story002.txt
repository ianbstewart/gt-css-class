 The following eloquent extract, from the AnnualReport of the Executive Committee of the AmericanAnti-Slavery Society, deserves the widest circulationthrough the press:— To Chief Justice Tancy belongs the bad eminencehaving elaborately falsified history, misconstruedlaw, and outraged justice and humanity, throughmore than twenty pages of his extended opinions, inthe vain attempt to prove that colored persons arenot, never were, and never could be, citizens of theUnited States; that when the Union was formed,and 'for more than a century before,' they 'hadbeen regarded as unfit to associate with the whiterace, either in social or political relations, and so farinterior, that they had no rights which the whiteman was bound to respect; that the negro mightjustly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit,that this opinion was, at that time, fixed anduniversal in the civilized portion of the white race,was regarded as an axiom in morals, as well as politicswhich no open to dispute;' and of course, that thisinferior, degraded race were then left, and still continue,so far as the Federal Government is concernedin the same rightless condition, incapable of askingof the Federal Courts redress for any wrong, andconsequently destitute of the legal recognition of anyright. Considering how feeble, helpless and alreadydeeply injured are the objects of this assaults, it ishard to say whether injustice, meanness or cruelty,unblushing falsehood, or sophistical misinterpretationof facts and law, is its most marked characteristic. no rights universal axiom no open to dispute The judge does not pretend that any clause or wordof the Constitution expressly debars black men fromcitizenship, or even hints at color or race as a test ofcivil rights; or that the States, before they enteredthe present Union, had generally set up, in terms,any such distinction as is contended for. The sumof his argument is, that 'the white race' cannot besupposed to have recognized as citizens a race whichthey so looked down upon. He cites freely from theany legislation of Congress and the States to provethe social degradation of the blacks, and thence inferstheir want of civil rights. But, unfortunately forhis purpose, this inference is flatly contradicted bythe well-established fact, that the Federal Governmenthas repeatedly naturalized colored aliens, andgiven passports to colored men, describing them ascitizens of the United States; and, in one instance,if not more, has officially complained of an act ofBritish aggression upon a colored American seaman,as having been committed upon a 'native citizen ofthe United States.' It is contradicted no less decisivelyby the fact referred to by Judge Curtis, inhis dissenting opinion, that in several of the States,(he might have said all but two, if we mistake not,)before the adoption of the Constitution, coloredmen. 'descended from African slaves,' were citizensof those States, and had the elective franchise 'onequal terms with other citizens.' Chancellor Kent,in his his Commentaries, says 'it is certain that theConstitution and Statute law of New York speak ofmen of color as being citizens;' and that 'if a slavebe born in the United States, and lawfully dischargingfrom bondage, or if a black man be born free inthe United States, he becomes thenceforward a citizens.The Supreme Court of North Carolina hasdecided that slaves born in that State, and manumittedthere, 'are citizens of North Carolina, andall free persons born within the State are born citizensof the State;' and had declared it 'a matter ofuniversal notoriety,' that free men of color had andused the right of voting, under the old Constitutionof that State. In Massachusetts and some otherStates, it is equally notorious, they have it still, andhave never been without it; and in those where theyhave it not, the use of the word 'white,' in prescribingthe qualifications of votes, was necessary totake it from them. That they were regarded as citizensin the old Confederation is proved conclusivelyby the fact, that a motion to limit the privileges ofgeneral citizenship to white persons was expresslyvoted down in the Congress, eight States opposingand only two supporting it, while the vote of onewas divided. infers There was no need of citing Statutes to prove thatthe colored people have all along been the objects ofprejudice and contempt. Nobody denies it. Butthis, so far from disproving their citizenship, ratherstrengthens the direct proof in its favor, drawn fromthe facts above mentioned. For the more degradedand despised they were, the less likely is it that theywere tolerated in any position to which they had noright, and especially in one so important as that ofco-soverigns of the Commonwealth; and consequently,the stronger I the evidence afforded bytheir voting, that they were recognized as citizens. Judge Taney endeavors to evade the force of theproof of citizenship from the fact of voting, by sayingthat 'a person may be entitled to vote by thelaw of the State, who is not a citizen of the Stateitself;' and instances 'foreigners not naturalized,'as being 'allowed to vote in some of the States.'Whether they are not, by such allowance, madecitizens of those States, or whether admission toshare in the sovereignty is not of course admission tocitizenship, may perhaps be reasonably questioned;but conceding this point, for the sake of the argument,it must still be borne in mind that when—orif—'persons not citizens' are allowed to vote, it isby some special provision of law on their particularbehalf; and as no such special provision existed inregard to the colored people, it follows that theirvoting was on the common ground of the generalright of citizenship. of course The judge, in his eagerness to make out a case,has grossly overstated the sentiment of the period inquestion, in regard to the colored people. The truthas to the general feeling toward them is bad enough;but he goes very far beyond the truth, in affirmingthat 'the opinion was universal in the civilized portionof the while race,' and 'disputed by no one,'that the negro might be justly enslaved for the whiteman's benefit, and had no rights which the whiteman was bound to respect. If not guilty of willfulfalsehood, he betrays an ignorance most astonishingin the chief judicial officer of the nation. truth Did he really know nothing of the emphatic voicesuch literature, law, philanthropy and religion,among 'the civilized portion of the white race,' haduttered at and before the time referred to, in behalfof the black man's rights, and against his enslavement?Was he not aware that the practice whichhe says was then universally thought to be just, hadbeen denounced within the time he specifies, by Cowperas 'human nature's broadest, foulest blot;' byWesley, as 'the sum of all villanies;' by Paley, as acrime' an 'wickedness;' by the historian Robertsonas 'repugnant to the feelings of humanity,' and'to the principles of religion;' by Bishop Warburton,as 'infamous,' and 'directly infringing bothDivine and human law;' and by many other writerson the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—poets,moralists, and divines, political economists, statesman,jurists, and others—as 'unjust, inhuman, unchristian-like;''contrary to all the laws of humanity,''a criminal and outrageous violation of thenatural rights of manking;' 'this enormity, thisaggravated iniquity;' 'a practice which spurns atall the principles of both natural and revealed religion;''a horrid practice, an injustice and barbaritywhich, so sure as there is vengeance in Heavenfor the wont of Crimea, will sometime b the destructionof all who allow or encourage it;' and, in aword, as deserving only abhorrence and reprobation?—that it called forth Montesquieu's often quotedsarcasm, 'We suit not allow the negroes in be men,or it will begin to be believed that we ourselves arenot Christians;' and the Abbe Raynal's declaration,that' he who supports the system of slavery is theenemy of the whole human race;' and Baxter's denunciationof slave-traders as 'the worst of robbers,'and of' those who buy and use the poor Africans asmere beasts for their own convenience, regardless oftheir spiritual welfare,' as 'fitter to be sailed demonsthan Christiana'? universally Did he never hear of Clarkson and Wilberforce,and the 'multitude of others,' (to use Clarkson'sown words,) who labored so zealously in the latterhalf of the eighteenth century for the abolition ofthe slave trade? or of the suggestion of the celebratedNecker, in 1784, that toe nations of Europeshould form a general compact to abolish that traffic?or of the persevering and successful exertions ofGranville Sharp, from 1765 to 1772, to procure anauthoritative exposition of British law against slaveryon British soil? Had be never learned, in thecourse of his legal studies, that full sixteen yearsbefore the American Federal Constitution was adopted,a decision of the highest Law Court in GreatBritain, pronounced by one of the ablest jurists ofthat age, and after thorough argument and long deliberation,declared slavery, whether of black men orof white, to be unlawful in that country, as a violationof natural right, contrary to common law principles,and so odious that nothing can be suffered tosupport it but positive law? or that a few yearslatter, but still before the framing of the Constitution,the Supreme Court of Massachusetts appliedto Negro Slaves the declaration in the Stale Bill ofRights, that 'all men have an unalienable right toenjoy liberty,' and thus abolished slavery in thatState? Did he not know that in nearly every State of theold Confederation, (and of the new Union, when itwas formed,) were Societies for promoting the abolitionof Slavery, and protecting the rights of thefree colored people, and that among their membersand officers were many of the boat, and some of themost illustrious men of that day? that the judicialseat he occupies was first filled by the President ofan Abolition Society, John Jay? that to the sameSociety the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander IHamilton, belonged? that Benjamin Franklin wasPresident of an Abolition Society, incorporated bythe Legislature of Pennsylvania, and that its Constitutioncalled ' all the children of men, members ofthe same family, however diversified by color, situation,'or otherwise; and declared it' more especiallythe duty of those who profess to maintain for themselvesthe rights of human nature, to use such meansas are in their power to extend the blessings of freedomto every part of the human race'? Had he never seen, among the proceedings of publicbodies just before the Revolution, that the people;of Fairfax county, Virginia, George Washingtonpresiding, pronounced the African Slave Trade'wicked, cruel and unnatural'? that the Freeholdersof Hanover County, Virginia, called it' mostdangerous to virtue and the welfare of this country '? ,that the Virginia Convention in 1774 complained ofthe King fur using his negative to defeat the attemptsof the Colony to stop that trade, and for''preferring the advantages of a few African corsairsto the rights of human nature, deeply wounded bythis infamous practice'? that an agreement wasformed by that Convention, by the North CarolinaConvention, by the Continental Congress, and bythe Georgia Provincial Congress, not to importslaves, or buy those imported by others? that theCommittee representing the people of Darien, Georgia,claiming to be 'influenced by a general philanthropyfor all mankind, of whatever climate, languageor complexion,' expressed their 'abhorrence ofthe unnatural practice or slavery in America, a practicefounded in injustice and cruelty, debasing partof our fellow-creatures below men, and corruptingthe virtue and morals of the rest'? or any of thenumerous similar testimonies of that period, and especiallythat introduced by Jefferson into the originaldraft of the Declaration of Independence, calling theslave-trade an 'execrable commerce,' and denouncingthe King of Great Britain as having, by his coursein regard to it, 'waged cruel war against humannature itself, violating its most sacred rights in the ,persons of a distant people, carrying them into slaveryin another hemisphere'? African corsairs complexion Could he be ignorant that in the very Conventionwhich framed the Constitution he professes to expound,Negro Slavery and the African Slave Tradewere denounced in the strongest terms by distinguishedmen, Northern and Southern; that GoverneurMorris said 'domestic slavery is a nefariousinstitution;' that Madison called it' the most oppressivedominion ever exercised by man over man,'and thought it' wrong to admit in the Constitutionthe idea that there could be property in men;' thatMason, of Virginia, styled the Slave Trade 'nefarious'and 'infernal,' and ' held it essential, is everypoint of view, that the General Government shouldhave power to prevent the increase of slavery;' thatRoger Sherman was 'against acknowledging men to,be property,' and 'regarded the slave-trade as iniquitous;'that Luther Martin, of Maryland, consideredit unjustifiable in its nature, and contrary'to the rights of mankind,' and? justly exposing usto the vengeance of Him who is equally Lord all,and who views with equal eye the poor Africanslave and Ms American master;' that in the Conventions,North and Sooth, which ratified the Constitution,the slave-trade was condemned with equalemphasis, being characterized by prominent speakersin the Virginia Convention as 'detestable' and ' nefarious;'and in that of North Carolina, as 'abominable,'inhuman,' 'utterly inconsistent with therights of humanity,' and 'probably reprobated byall the same members of the Federal Convention; while,in that of South Carolina, General Pinckney, whohad been a member of the Federal Convention, testifiedthat, on the slave question, the South Carolinadelegates there 'had to contend with the religiousand political prejudices of the Eastern and MiddleStates,' whose people 'reprobate as an unpardonablemoral and political evil, the dominion they (of theSouth) hold over a part of the human race'? Judge Taney has the effrontery to cite even theDeclaration of Independence in support of his atrociousargument. He admits, indeed, that its language'would term to embrace the whole humanfamily, and, if used in a similar instrument at thisday, would be so understood;' but denies that itwas then understood to include 'the enslaved Africanrace,' because, if it had been, 'the conduct of thedistinguished men who framed the Declarationwould have been flagrantly inconsistent with theprinciples they asserted,'—a thing he assumes to bedearly impossible; for they were 'incapable of assertingprinciples inconsistent with those on whichthey were acting. 'Indeed! Let us hear a little oftheir own testimony about that. then To what does the Judge think Jefferson alluded—the very man who drafted the Declaration and putinto it originally that denunciation of the slave tradewhich we have just quoted,—when be exclaimed atthe incomprehensibility of man, who can endure somuch for his own liberty, 'and the neat moment,deaf to all those motives whose power supported himthrough his trial, inflict on his fellow-men a bondage,one hour of which is fraught with more miserythan ages of that which he rose in rebellion to oppose'?Lather Martin says it was urged in theFederal Convention, against the concessions made toslavery in the Constitution, 'that our opposition toGreat Britain was grounded upon the preservationof rights to which God and nature entitled us, notin particular, but in common with all the rest of mankind.'Patrick Henry, writing in 1779, confessesthat, in holding slaves, his' conduct was inconsistentwith the principles 'he 'asserted,' and adds,' Iwill not, cannot justify it. I will so far pay my devoirto Virtue, as to own the rectitude of her precepts,and lament my want of conformity to them.'William Pinckney, in 1788, pronounces slavery 'oppressive,unjust, and inconsistent with the greatgroundwork of the late Revolution.' The Legislatureof Pennsylvania, in 1780, in the Act abolishingslavery in that State, speaks of 'negro slaves' as'deprived of the common blessings that they were bynature entitled to;' and avows among the reasonsfor the Act, that 'we conceive ourselves at this particularperiod extraordinarily called upon, by theblessings we have received, to manifest the sincerityof our professions;' and then proceeds, 'in justiceto persons so unhappily circumstanced, and in gratefulcommemoration of our own happy deliverance'from British tyranny, to enact the gradual abolitionof slavery in Pennsylvania. In 1788, in a Reporton a petition in favor of the distressed Africansand their descendants,' a Legislative Committee inthe same State quoted from the Declaration of Independencethe affirmation of the inalienable rights ofall men, adding that 'if it is founded in truth, thepetitioners speak but the Divine Will in requestingthat this evil (slavery) he done away from the land.Many pages might be filled with similar testimonies,showing that the Declaration was understood, in thatday, to assert the rights of the 'whole human family,'without distinction of race or color, and thatthe 'flagrant inconsistency ' therewith of holdingslaves and supporting slavery was then also seen andacknowledged. Indeed, it was the very time of theframing of the Constitution, which William Pinckneycalled 'this enlightened period ' at which 'weneed not labor to prove' slavery disgraceful, 'and ascandal to human nature.' notin particular, but in common with all the rest of mankind. his this particularperiod extraordinarily sincerityof our professions was Thus it is abundantly evident, not only that JudgeTaney's conclusion is unwarranted by his premises,but that his premises are gross exaggerations orutter falsehoods, and consequently that his attemptto prove colored men incapable of citizenship is acomplete failure.
