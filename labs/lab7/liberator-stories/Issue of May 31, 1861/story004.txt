 A correspondent of the Charleston Courier, writingfrom Richmond, anticipates an attack upon that,"the gem of the State, the Koh-i-noor upon whichLincoln and that twin-hearted brother of his, therecreant Scott, are feasting their gaze as the richestprize of the South." "Possibly," he says, the "gloriousSeventh," that orchestra of military virtues,will lead the vanguard—-glorious" in their cleanfaces, languishing side whiskers, good clothes, whitekids and patent leather boots; and possibly theymay be received, but not as before. It will be a"welcome with bloody hands to hospitable graves."Zonaves, rowdies. New York thieves and cut-throats,mingled with a hodge-podge of Jerseymen, RhodeIslanders, Massachusetts men, wooden nutmeg Yankeesand Down Easters may also come—a solid,gaping phalanx; but be met by a wall ofSouthern hearts, who will turn them in their tracks,or annihilate them from their soil. There is a greatdifference between fighting for wages or for an abstractidea, and fighting for mothers and sisters"Beauty and booty" may be a temptingmotto with which to invade your neighbor's fireside,but it is one which wipes out all the landmarks ofcivilized warfare, and will secure for its follower thefate of the brute."
