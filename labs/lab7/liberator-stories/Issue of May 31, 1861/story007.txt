Let the sons of SouthCarolina answer to the call from the sons of Col.Howard, who led the Maryland line in triumphover the bloody battle-field of Cowpens. Let themknow that we will return that blood with full interest,and let them feel that they are now, as theywere then, our brothers. March to Virginia, andlay your heads upon the bosom of this mother ofStates, and hear her great heart beat with new impulsesfor a renewed and glorious independence. Surely the good and the virtuous of the NorthernStates cannot sanction the lawless and brutal despotismnow inaugurated at Washington. Be ready! stand by your arms—mark time tothe tap of independence, and at the word, marchforward and onward to the Borders. Our gloriousold sister, North Carolina, is with you, and her freemen-arein arms. Join them in the struggle fordefence; and let tyrants know that there are menwho can make them hear the ring and feel theweight of Southern steel. I shall endeavor not toexpose our own State, and shall only march youbeyond our borders under pressing emergency; butwherever the Confederate flag floats, there too isour country, now and forever. pressing emergency F.F.
