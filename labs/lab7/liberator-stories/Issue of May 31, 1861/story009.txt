NION PRINGS Gov. Andrew: Sir,—We see in a New York paperthat you have requested the authorities of Baltimoreto send the bodies of the soldiers of your regimentthat were killed at Baltimore back to Bostonpacked in ice, at the expense of the Common Wealth.We also see that you anticipate sending 200,000men to coerce the South, to march from Washingtoncity to Pensacola. Now, as it is very probablethat some of these soldiers will be killed, we proposeto take a contract for sending back their, deadbodies, so as to be much cheaper to your people andgive general satisfaction to their kindred, the followingis our proposition:— Gov. Andrew 200,000 For the first thousand, $50.00 per head.

In all instances, commissioned officers will becharged double the above rates. Should your Excellency be pleased to give us thecontract, we will thank you to notify us immediately,or as soon as the Northern army crosses Mason&Dixon's line; for it will be necessary for whoevertakes the contract to begin at that point, asLee, and Beauregard, and Ben. McCullock, andJefferson Davis will be there to receive them, andwill be very apt to kill a few—and we would regardit a great calamity for the Northern soldier to spoil;besides, we Southerners, in our hot climate, dislikeoffensive smells. After due reflection, and somelittle Christian consideration, we will be pleased tohear from you. kill a few spoil; hot little Christian Very respectfully,TONEY &WAUGH."
