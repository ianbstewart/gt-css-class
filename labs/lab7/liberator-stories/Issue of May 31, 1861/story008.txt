 That our readers may see a little of the spirit ofthe South, we publish an extract from the RichmondDispatch, and we could fill our paper everyday with similar extracts from the Southern press: Dispatch "It is not a war of punctilio between sovereigns;nor of conflicting interests between rival nationsâ€”admitting of adjustment and compromise. It is awar of fanaticism sad subjugation on the part ofthe North; of scorn and contemptuous hatred onthe part at the South. These angry passions are uncontrollable, transportingand impressible. The Sooth would sacrificeeverything it holds dear, before it would succumbto the authority of the despised North; andthe North will forget all schemes of gain, and throwits ledgers into the fire, to indulge its fanatical hatredof slavery, to 'crash out' the slaveholder. * * We cannot build conclusions in regard to theduration of this war upon considerations of interests.The foes we have to fight are madman.The madness which we combat is the same madnesswhich has for thirty years been abusing and vilifyingthe best customers of the people it possessed,which has spread discord and hatred throughoutthe land, which has diabolically cut the bonds ofUnion, pulled down the pillars of the fairest governmentthat ever blessed mankind. It has done all this, not in the wanton Spirit ofvicious destructiveness, but in the spirit of a sort ofperverted piety, in the zeal of God-service, and thefurore of a blind and sublimated fanaticism. Is it tobe supposed that the same reckless spirit wife stop toCalculate the cost and consequences of a war towhich it has been educating its devotees for thirtyyears? The probabilities are very unfavorable to a speedytermination of hostilities. The safest policy for theSouth is to prepare for a long-continued war. Herpreparations ought to be on a thorough and permanentscale."
