 The Richmond (Va.) Examiner indulges in thishighly amusing view of the North and its soldiers: Examiner "The North has no officers to command or drillthe cowardly, motley crowd of starving foreignersand operatives that it proposes to send South to fillditches and as food for cannon, because it has noroom in its penitentiaries and poor-houses to receiveor sustain them. The regular troops of the Union,since the resignation of the Southerners, is deficientin officers; and who are to drill and command the73,000 sheep? If are except Benedict Arnold, there never was aNorthern man who was filled to command, if youwould give him a chance to run! Like cowardlyboys, when pent up on ship-board, without a chanceof escape, they gather courage from despair, andfight desperately. But with ninety-nine Northernmen in a hundred, on all occasions, duty, honor,patriotism, has ever been considered a mere matterof profit and loss. Since the days of Washington,they have ever deemed that coarse of conduct bywhich most money is male and least risk incurred,the most virtuous and honorable. If are except Benedict Arnold, there never was aNorthern man who was filled to command, if youwould give him a chance to run They will not come to Washington, they cannotbe handcuffed and driven to Washington, if we onlyprecede them, and let them sec that they will haveto fight for glory, and not for spoils and plunder.They never did fight, and never will fight, exceptfor pay. for pillage and plunder. Once satisfy themthat no money is to be made, no plunder to be gottenby invading the South, and no power on earthcan lash and kick them south of Mason and Dixon'sline."
