 "I lay this down as the law of nations. I say that militaryauthority takes, for the time, the place of all municipalinstitutions, and SLAVERY AMONG THE REST;and that, under that state of things, so far from its beingtrue that the States where slavery exists have the exclusivemanagement of the subject, not only the PRESIDENT OFTHE UNITED STATES, but the COMMANDER OF THE ARMY,HAS POWER TO ORDER THE UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATIONOF THE SLAVES. . . . . From the instantsthat the slaveholding States become the theatre of a war,CIVIL, servile, of foreign, from that instant the war powersof Com extend to interference with the institution ofslavery, IN EVERY WAY IN WHICH IT CAN BE WITH, from a claim of indemnity for slaves taken or destroyed,power. . . . It is a war power. I say it is a warpower; and when your country is actually in war, whetherit be a war of invasion of a war of insurrection, Congresshas power to carry on the war, and MUST CARRY IT ON, ACCORDINGTO THE LAWS OF WAR; and by the laws of war,an invaded country has all its laws and municipal institutionsswept by the heard, and MARTIAL POWER TAKES THEPLACE OF THEM. When two hostile armies are not in martialarray, the commanders of both armies have power to emancipateall the slaves in the invaded territory."â€”J.Q. ADAMS.
