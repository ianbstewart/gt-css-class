 ☞While we would accord to Wendell Phillips,as we would accord to every citizen, the furl measureof his constitutional rights, we are at a loss to conceivehow certain high functionaries of the Governmentcan reconcile it with their sense of proprietyto bestow on this rabid and abusive radical the publicmarks of distinguished consideration with whichthey have honored him. The presiding officer ofeach branch of Congress has bestowed on him attentionswhich, under the circumstances, were most unseemlyand impolitic. There is no victorious generalin the army, nor any loyal governor of a freeState, who would have been treated with moremarked courtesy than was bestowed on this makerof seditious harangues, who has bean twenty yearsdenouncing the Constitution and aiming at the dissolutionof the Union.—New York World.
