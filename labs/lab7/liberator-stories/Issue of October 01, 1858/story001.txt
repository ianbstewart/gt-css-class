 The United States Constitution is 'a covenant withdeath, and an agreement with hell.' ☞'The free States are the guardians and essentialsupports of slavery. We are the jailers and constablesof the institution. . . . There is some excusefor communities, when, under a generous impulse,they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States,and by force restore their rights; but they are withoutexcuse in aiding other States in binding on men anunrighteous yoke. On this subject, OUR FATHERS, INFRAMING THE CONSTITUTION, SWERVED FROM THERIGHT. We their children, at the end of half a century,see the path of duty more clearly than they,and must walk in it. To this point the public mindhas long been tending, and the time has come for lookingat it fully, dispassionately, and with manly andChristian resolution. . . . No blessing of the Unioncan be a compensation for taking part in the enslavingof our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to beperpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that itcan only continue through our participation in wrongdoing. To this conviction the free States are tending.' they are withoutexcuse in aiding other States in binding on men anunrighteous yoke. ONSTITUTION must walk in it. —WILLIAM ELLERY CHANRINE.
