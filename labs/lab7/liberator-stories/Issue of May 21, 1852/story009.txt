 The only way in which it has ever been attemptedby intelligent men to sustain the constitutionalityof the scoundrel act against the claims of habeascorpus and jury trial, has been to pretend that theobject of the law was not a decisive trial of the rightto liberty, but only a preliminary investigation withreferences to removal to another jurisdiction. Thiswas the argument of Curtia, Clifford, &c., and noother so far as we know, has been attempted. But a single paragraph fully answers all this. Theconstitution does not say that persons charged withowing labor, but persons positively owing it shall bedelivered up. The State ought not—cannot giveup any other. Till this is ascertained to the satisfactionof the most searching legal scrutiny, there is noshadow of obligation to surrender at all, but the Stateis bound to protect to the last extremity. But theargument itself concedes that this law does not actthat question, therefore it settles nothing, and theman goes free. Nobody pretends that that question canbe legally ascertained without a jury trial, watch theact does not allow. It therefore does not place theaccused, on the showing of it advocates, in the conditionwhere the constitution holds him liable. Consequently,it is so impudent sham, and should betreated as such,—Ibid. positively owing  nothing Ibid.
