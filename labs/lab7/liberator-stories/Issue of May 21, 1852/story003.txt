 BRO.STEVENS:—The Herald comes regularly tohand, and so far I am well pleased with it. We Virginiansadmire the course you purpose. And nowwill you permit me to propound a few interrogationsto you and the readers of the Herald in referenceto slavery? 1st. Is slavery right? If it is, where isthe necessity for the church legislating on that subjectfrom time to time? Where was the proprietyof dealing with Bishop Andrew and F.A. Hardingin 1844, for the mere ownership of slave, for wehave no evidence of their mistreating them in anyshape or form. 2d. Is it wrong? If so, why doesthe church still tolerate it in its blackest forms, for does both tolerate slaveholders and slave-dealerswithin her pale? I will here give you a fewexamples which came under any own observation:One P.E., of the Western Virginia Conference ofthe M.E. Church, and a delegate to the next GeneralConference in Boston, is a slaveholder to all interestsand purposes. Another P.E. of the sameConference was a slaveholder last year; that slavehas since been sold, and this same P.E. pocketedthe money. A Local Preacher in the bounds of theBaltimore Conference sole a slave to a slave trader—and he still remains a local Preacher in saidConference in good standing; and a prominent membersof the  the same Conference, sold six,the mother and five children, at public auction. Theslave trader bought the mother and one child; theothers were scattered. An individual present at thetime of the sale, not a member of any church, remarkedthat it was truly heart-rendering to hear theshrieks of these poor creatures. as they were placedon the block and cried off to the highest bidder. RO. TEVENS   These things are permitted to pass here unpunishedby those who have charge of the work; andin fact, some of the preachers tell their membersthey may buy as many slaves as they can pay for.We regard these great inconsistencies—pleasegive us light.
