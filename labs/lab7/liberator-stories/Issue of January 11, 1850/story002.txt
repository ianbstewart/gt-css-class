 Were a full knowledge of the responsibility which to h who ventures prophecy upon a mala much moment as the overthrow of an emabout dealing to speak any word which probably be con-trued into a threat—with the as if which our pasture is susceptible, all the redirection which the weight of the scums to demand we do declare it as ourrable opinion, that the success of this step will spontaneously by a dissolution of theCoast. That Northern brethren and deceived—ut,usefully it any be must disastrously—dewith regard to the South, and the delusion has kept up by the Northern press with a pertinacitywhich, under present circumstances, is truly reportableThey have mistaken the money gaseousness been renting itself in certain quarters, fora latterly years, when there was the danger,and  has been found to dwindle down into a subssire shine when danger approached, for the dispositionof the whole South. They have been taughtto look with contempt upon exhibitions of this characterwhich, for from intimidating, point ant alwaysthe quarter in which the largest degree of oppressionand must may be practiced with the smallest amountor risk. They have seen this disposition in theSouth, and they have must irrationally concluded thatit was general. We tell them again, never wasmistake more utter, more unhappy, and, if persistedis, more certain to lead to fatal, consequences.The large body of the Southern people—the willas who would, in the supposed case, be called onto set—are no blusterers for fire-eaters. They despiseall such displays as those alluded to, as thoroughlyas they are despised every where else, wherevergood state exists, and they are for from meaningto mistake them. W tell the people of the North,that there is among all classes throughout the SouthernStates a deep, calm, settled determination, whichseeks not to rent itself in words, and which will findno utterance until the day of action shall have arrived.They love the Union almost as the Jews lovedthe Temple of Solomon. The arts of demagogues,the most hateful of all the creatures to whom naturehas given birth, have been insufficient to wean theiraffections from the splendor fabric bequeathed totheir care by the wisdom of their fathers. They stillretain, for the children of those who, equally withtheir own fathers, assisted at its consecration, theaffection due to brethren. But their sentiments uponcertain points are as fixed and unalterable as thedecrees of destiny itself, and upon no other more decidedlythan upon this, the most important of all. Itis a matter of small consequence whether they berighter whether they be wrong. Argument in sucha case is of no avail. Rhetoric falls coldly upon thecare of those whose minds are already made up. Itis useless to preach to them of consequences; torepresent the value of the Union; to depict the resultswhich would spring from its disruption; todwell upon the deplorable conduction in which it wouldinvolve all quarters of the country. All these thingsthey have deltately and maturely weighed, andhave made up their minds to the crisis, in spiteof them all. Viewing the contemplated abolition ofslavery in the District of Columbia as a direct infringementupon rights which they have a been accustomedto regard as severed, they ulteve that theywould be ant to the trust confided to them bytheir fathers, were they for a moment to permit theconsiderations of convenience to weight a feather inthe scale. They ask, if they give way its one point,be it small as it may, what security can they haveagainst the extension of the encroachment. Theyreal to mind the conduct of their revolutionary pareses,who tried causes with the powerful governmentof Great Britain, rather than st to a tax sosmall that it could not be felt, because they commandedan infringement of their chartered rights.Thus they treats, and with all their attachment tothe man, they prefer to sacrifice every advantagethey may detune from it, rather than st to whatis a regard as palpable in nature.                Union      If we supposed that our colors could penetratn the of legislature, we would exert it in imploringthese who are bent upon this rumens scheme to in their disastrous carver. Already are thethis between the two sections of the Union be weaker and lesser. Already are theready enemies of the Union, abundant both in theNorth and the South, exulting in the mischief which fancy on the point of consummation. Theyregard this a because as their great weapon as thefire brand which is to kindle a flame which the ingeof man cannot extinguish, a flame which,slave thus yet attended more than its sixtieth year, she the stately Empire of Liberty in ruin, these who have so long notshipped at itstake the Jews when the ploughshare was runever the ground where there Temple stand, house wanderers upon the face of theearth All that the South require of their Northern is, that they shall keep their hands off.They ask be exertion, no sacrifice. Willing to leave brethren in uninterrupted repose, they only deferthat the same measure of forbearance maybe extendedtowards themselves. They cannot conceivethat t materially interest the citizens of Boston,or Providence, or Cincinnati—having, as they have,so many objects appealing to their philanthropy athouse—that the District of Columbia should be defree territory; at least, not so materially that consent to sacrifice the Union for itstake They cannot benefit the slaves themselves,eat the first appearance of danger, every one of would be transported beyond the reach of Congress.They can do no good to any person, while onthe South they would instinct what this quarter of theUnion, right or wrong, is determined to regard asan employed injury.                  The question we solemnly regard as one involvingthe continence of the Union. Stripped of all itssecretaries, such is the aspect which it presents.We those who have the destinies of this greatRepublic in their hands consent to such a consummation?
