 It is a grave question, whether there is a provisionin the United States Constitution for the protectionof the citizens of one State while traveling in another.In the case of Barrett, the inquiry was made, 'Whatcan be done for him against the authorities of SouthCarolina, no as to protect him in his rights as a citizenof Ohio? A learns Judge of the SupremeCourt of the United States replied, that there was'no mode of reaching his case; it was a point over-lookedin the formation of the Government.' If thisbe true, it must finally destroy the union of the States.How can we be contented with a government whichimposes taxes upon us, and afds us no protection?We know of at least one individual who was muchopposed to Abolition and Abolitionists, now completelyconverted into a Dismount, by the conduct ofSouth Carolina to Mr. Barrett. If the same thinghad happened in Mexico, the United States wouldhave gone to war, rather than allowed one of ourcitizens to have been thus treated. But South Carolinadoes as she places with a citizen of Ohio, guiltyof no crime, a violator of no law, human or divine,calling for any civil penalty; she arrests him, searcheshis person, takes away him private letters andpapers, publishes them in her newspapers, with insultingcomments; casts him into prison, refuses tobail tiles, confines him closely four months in thesickliest season of the year, threatens to inet deathupon him, law, or no law; and finally, having notestimony to commit him upon, she taken from him acertificate of deposit for a thousand dollars, which hehad in his concession, but which she had no right, toretain; as the perditions upon which it was that hadnot been lied with, and leaving him to pay Lawyer'sthan to she amount of $200—she lam thecn that, he pattern to be, d at the next termor Court! and than, on it to  men of the thousanddollars, threaten him with Lynch law, should beever return. If there ever were a biter act of bsupon the face of earth than these of John M. Barrett, they must have lived in somedark region which civilized man has never yet visited.          Yes the United States Government can do nothingin the case. What in the government fit for?What is it worth? Is it only to protect us from thewrongs that may be perpetrated by foreign nattens?Comparatively few of our citizens go abroad, but intercoursebetween the States is common. How is acitizen of Ohio to be redressed against South Carolina,outrage —The Governor of Ohio was written toon the subject. He did not even reply to the communication.Was it because be felt himself powerlessto act? If so, then we are the losers by havinga federal government, for without it, Ohio could demandand enforce redress. As it is, if she attempt it,then the United States Government interposes, notto have justice done, but to quell what would he calledcivil war. Is this so? Can Ohio do nothing inthe care? Are her hands tied? Is she bound by afederal compact to suffer her citizens to he insultedand abused? Then, of what value is the Union?We leave the question, what our readers may reflectupon it for themselves, seriously.  demand enforce
