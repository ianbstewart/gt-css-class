There is no man inthe language of national jurisprudence that can define it—no modal in the record of ancient history, or in the politicaltheories of Aristotle, with which can be latewood. Itwas introduced into the Constitution of the United Statesby an eluviations—a representation of property under thename of persons. Little did the member of the Conventionfrom the Free State imagine under the mask of this concession."—JOHN QUINCY ADAMS. OHN UINCY DAMS.
