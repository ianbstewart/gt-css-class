 This document has been before our readers aweek, and has been, we doubt not, generally read.This circumstance will therefore save us the necessityof noticing its language or sentiments atlarge. It begins with professions of peace, whichall the President's official conduct shows are falseand hypocritical. The President lays great stresson the greatest lie of the age, voted by Congress,that 'War exists by the act of Mexico.' Thatdeclaration of n partisan Congress, he deemsabundantly sufficient to change all the truths in theworld into falsehoods. Be it demonstrated everso clearly that war actually exists by the act of thePresident—that by his order, without consultingCongress then in session, our army was marchedinto Mexican territory—that by his command, unknownto Congress, the Mexican forces were attackedand routed upon their own soil—there isone answer ever ready—that vote of Congress, that'war exists by the act of Mexico'! We desire always to respect the powers that he.We would speak harshly of none in authority.—But we cannot avoid feeling, as we look over thisdocument, that we are indeed fallen on evil times,and that no fear of God or love of truth is in thehearts of our rulers. The President, both in hislast year's message and the present, is fain to reiteratehis efforts for peace; as if the facts did notall show that he desired nothing so much as to seethe only Republic on earth, save our own, bumbled,prostrate and bleeding at Iris feet. Such isstill his desire. To this, and this only, comes allhis talk about 'conquering a peace.' The truth is,the President wants no peace. His every act, bothbefore and since the war commenced, proves this.Having tasted blood and met with the Patriotic resistanceof a feeble yet determined people, battlingfor their altars and homes, like the fretted blood-hound,be seems resolved to slake his maddenedambition in the heart's blood of his victim. Talk,indeed, of the President's desire for peace! Fromthe hour when he madly and wickedly plunged thisnation into an unconstitutional war, there has neverbeen a moment when he could not have had anhonorable peace. He had but to speak the word.and it was done. This was demonstrated beyondall cavil in the late negotiation with Mr. Twist.—The Mexicans offered to make the 'desert betweenthe Nueces and the Rio Grande' the boundary, andhind themselves to found no Mexican settlementsthis side the Rio Grande. In addition to this, theyoffered us the territory of Upper California, alongthe whole boundary of Oregon; being nearly orquite a third of their whole country. This wasrejected—the flame of war was again lighted;andsince that time new thousands of Americas andMexican corpses have been huddled into a commongrave. Still the President would stultify thepeople of the United States by pretending that hewants nothing but an honorable peace! Out uponsuch hypocrisy. The President is evidently mad with the ambitionto be a conqueror. Ancillary to this, is hisambition to wake slavery the ruling power of thiscontinent. This be rightly calculates can be donein no way to certainly as by the aid of a largestanding army. Other countries have been enslavedby this agency. And why may not the libertiesof Mexico and our own country bow beforethe wand of military despotism? As sure as thereis truth in heaven and justice in the earth, this warmust step, the mud career of the President mustbe out short, the sword  be sheathed and ourarmy disbanded, or our liberties are all lost, andlost forever. History teaches no more universaltruth than that those governments which wagetwars of  against their neighbors, seldomfail to enslave their own people. Already is morethan the first step takes towards our own slavery.Already o the  of our  Presidentclaim for their  authority overthe free thought an free speech of this country.—Already are we told, that, however great may bethe stretches of power of which the President maybe guilty, we most not open our  Like that are dumb beside their , thepeople may  the Presidents  every of American freedom, and word against it. To  is to  the governmentand . In Heaven's same, howmuch is this short of the most  slavery?                 We have already extended our remarks beyondwhat we intended. We cannot avoid alludinghowever, to one or two other topics treated in themessage. One of these is the President's recommendationof a tax on tea and coffee. The rebukehe received from the last Congress, in which friends constituted an overwhelming majority,should have taught him something. He seems determined,however, to learn nothing by experience.Having set his heart to a tax exclusively on freeNorthern articles, he w resolved to be deterredby no obstacles from accomplishing his purpose.But the most astonishing and infamous propositionever made by him or any other President, is hisrecommendation to Congress to make an appropriationto pay for the A misted slaves. The circumstances ofthat case arc still, we presume,fresh in the recollection of our readers. A cargoof men were stolen in Africa -certain West IndianSpaniards. While upon the high tens, theyrose upon their enslavers, released themselvesfrom chains, and came into a port in Connecticut.They were claimed by their pretended owners, asSlaves. After a full and fair trial they were adjudgedfree, and permitted to return to their nativecountry from which they had been practicallystolen. And now a democratic (?) President of theUnited States recommends that these 'man-thieves'he paid out of the people's money, the price of theblood and souls of men stolen from their homesand native land! Who can read such a recommendationand not blush to think himself an American?   democratic The following it a copy of an ADDRESS from Womenof Scotland to Women of America. The Addressis very numerously signed, and was sent tothis country by the hands of Henry C. Wright. Itis intended that it shall be unrolled and exhibitedit Faneuil Hall, during the Fair, this week:— DDRESS   DEAR SISTKRS: EAR ISTKRS Enjoying freedom ourselves, our desire is, thatits blessings should be extended to every memberof the human family. In your country there arethree millions of our fellow-mortals, descendedfrom the same Parent as ourselves, in whose veinsrun the same blood as in our own—whose visagesbear the same Divine impress—whose hearts aresusceptible of the same impulses—whose soulsmust stand before the same judgment-seat, and inhabitthe same eternity as our own—who, not withstandingtheir being under a Government, the fundamentaldeclaration of whose Constitution is,'That all are born free and equal,' have, in disregardof any principle of nature and religion, beenrobbed of their most sacred rights—doomed bythe laws of your country to a perpetual and degradingbondage—regarded as beasts of burden—bought and sold as articles of merchandise—allthe ties of social life disregarded—the husband andwife, the parent and the child, subject to be foreverseparated—deprived of every means of instruction,intellectual and moral—and, above all, denuded ofthat liberty which is the right of every human beingbreathing the vital air. We ask you to pause and reflect on this ly and wicked state of things; emancipate yourselvesfrom that bondage of custom, or prejudice.or interest, under which you may be laboring;contemplate the horrors of the slave system withan open and candid mind; realize, as far as youcan, an adequate conception of the realities of thisevil; ascertain in what way you stand connectedwith it; and, looking at that connection in the lightof a final reckoning, decide at once whether slaveryis in future to count, upon you as friends or foes.Our religion teaches that God is the Father of usall, and that freedom is the sacred birthright of allhis children. We, therefore, protest against anymember of this family robbing any other of thisinalienable gift, and call upon all who have escapedthe horrors of bondage to break these fetters,and let the oppressed go free.  It grieves us to learn that not a few of you, whoprofessedly recognize the Christian religion as therule of life, are actually identified with the slavesystem of your country, living in the very midst ofit, surrounded by those whom God has endowedwith the same gifts as yourselves, and who, youcannot deny, are brothers and sisters of that greatfamily to which you belong. They are kept inbondage for your makes; they are deprived of intellectual,moral and religions culture, that theymay the better serve your selfish purposes. Thereis no necessity impelling you to hold longer overthem the rod of the oppressor; you may, if yonchoose, wash your hands, at once, clean of thisevil;—do not imagine that because you have beenborn and educated in the midst of slavery, thatyou are guiltless, or at least comparatively innocent,however much these unhappy circumstancesmay have tended to blunt your moral sensibilities,or to mitigate your guilt when you lived (if it werepossible so to live) in ignorance of your criminality;be assured that now, when your attention hasbeen called to the sinfulness of your position, thatif you have left in your breasts one single vestigeof that moral perception which distinguishes ournature, so long as you stand in any degree identifiedwith slavery, that you are unmitigated transgressorsof the immutable laws of God's moral government. We urge you once more humbly to review thePrinciples of the Christian religion. Ponder wellthat great commandment which includes all others,—'Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,and thy neighbor as thy self:—learn again the spiritof that golden maxim, 'do onto others as ye wouldthey should do unto you.' Are you willing tochange conditions with those who are. held inbondage by you, or for you? Are you willing toentrust your future happiness to the caprice of thetask-master—at his will to be torn from your husbandor father, your child or sister, and separatedforever? Are you prepared to abandon all yourrights civil and religious—to be deprived of everymeans of instruction—to be herded as cattle are—sold at the auction block to the highest bidder—your parsons to be flogged, abused or destroyed,as beat suits the purposes of those into whosehands you may fall? If not, then love your neighboras yourselves, do unto others as ye would theyShould do unto you,—of at once honestly renouncethe preferred service of a Master whom you arenot willing to obey;—fax bettor for yourselves, andfor the cause of suffering humanity, that you boldlyrenounce a religion which lays you under restrictionsto which you are resolved not to than that you should deceive the world and yourown selves, by attempting to do what never can bedone— serve both God and Mammon.  We would affectionately warn you against attemptingto defend your position, by appeals to the supposedpractices of Old Testament times. TheBible is only an open book to these who read itwith honest hearts; to all others its instructionsare staled up; if your desire in reading is to findan apology for slavery, you will not leave your taskdisappointed; but if your simple desire is to knowthe truth and obey it, then the truth shall makeyourselves as well as your bondsmen free, Bearit in mad, that our controversy is not with theslavery of by good times, but with that slaverywhich exists at this moment in your own land.Let it own merits. The only legitimatesChristian mode of setting this matter, is  Shut your  then,till you have  the slave system  youhave, as  become sequencedwith its character; and then open the volume, submit slavery to its tribunal, and tell usif it comes forth justified or condemned.         There are in your country a large class, who,Not being actually involved in the slave system,imagine that that they occupy a neutral position, andare therefore free from the charge of supportingslavery. To such we would say, between rightand wrong there is no neutral ground. 'He whois not with us is against us,' is the language ofOne who always spoke the truth; if you are notprotesting against slavery, if you have not repudiatedthe fellowship of those who live by its existence,then, according to the statement of Jesus,you are not with us, but with those who are againstus. There can be no greater or more fatal error thanto imagine, that slavery depends for its existenceupon the holders of slaves;—it could not exist ayear if left solely to depend upon them for support;they are the mere executors of the religioussentiment of your country on this matter, andwould be powerless under a correct public opinion.Your pro-slavery Chinches are 'the Bulwarksof Slavery;' they are giving their mighty influenceto perpetuate the preset t state of things;they have refrained from declaring the criminalityof man attempting to hold property in his fellowman:—nay,they defend such a state of things, asperfectly consistent with the precepts and spirit ofChristianity. They have received into their mostintimate fellowship the slaveholders of your land.and thus endorsed the whole system as good; theyare not with us, but against us. The Church has,in every age and in every country, been the mostpowerful regulator of public sentiment, inasmuchas it deals with the religious feelings of the people;but the Church is made up of its individualmembers, so its influence is the combination oftheirs. If your influence, then, has been throwninto the common stock of any church, where slaveryand its supporters are not the subjects of separationand unqualified condemnation, are you freefrom the charge of perpetuating this evil and prolongingits horrors? We would remind you thatour guilt, in connection with any system of iniquity,can only be measured by the amount of influencewe possess. The more reputedly good menor women are, the more dangerous do they become,when they sanction that which is evil; slaveryreaps a greater harvest from the silence ofsuch, than from the efforts of all the slaveholdersin your land. Let your Churches give forth anunqualified condemnation of this system, let yourMinisters fearlessly declare from their pulpits itstrue character, and slavery, with its attendant evils,will speedily disappear; but if they persist in perpetuatingthis fearful delusion, iniquity will waxstronger and stronger, till those virtues which arethe only guarantee of your country's preservationshall he blotted out. We would say, then, take decided action; letyour creed be, no compromise with slavery—nocommunion with slaveholders; if the church towhich you belong will not stand forth in vindicationof the rights of your colored countryman, thenbe faithful to your religion— Come out of her, mypeople, that ye pa-take not of her sins, and that yereceive not of her plagues.' To that small, but ever-increasing class, who, fora long series of yearn have, amid scorn and persecution,been devoting their entire energies to thework of your country's emancipation, we look withfeelings of the deepest sympathy and the fondesthope; we have not been inattentive observers ofthe self—sacrificing course of William Lloyd Garrisonand his devoted  peers. The countlessattempts made by the pro-slavery men of your landto blast their reputation, and the unbounded confidenceplaced in them by your colored population,is to our minds conclusive evidence of their exaltedworth, of their growing success, and of our ownbounden duty to cheer and aid them on by everymeans in our power. We have been privilegedto meet here with some of those noble spirits—ourminds have been improved, our understandingsenlightened, our hearts warmed by their eloquentpleadings on behalf of the slave; and our appealsnow are but the result of their labors amongst us,the echo of n voice from your shores returning torouse you to action.  For Maria Weston Chapman, and our other sisterswho have so long and so nobly struggled forthe freedom of others, we would entreat your sympathyand regard; and this request we make notfor their sakes, but for the sake of those whose deliverancefrom bondage is the object for whichthey live, and for which, we doubt not, they areprepared to die. They have never sought to accomplishtheir work by pondering a corruptpublic sentiment, or by courting popular applause;but trusting to the righteousness of their cause,they have put their trust in the God of the oppressed,and faithfully spoken what they believed. Though separated from their field of labor by aboisterous ocean, yet our hearts and prayers andlabors are one with their own. We know thatScotland can do much to break the rod of the oppressor.Although she has no slaves treading hersoil, yet she is not without apologists for those whotread yours; and, by the help of God, we will notcease our agitation till every apologist has beensilenced, and every slave emancipated. How longwe may require to labor, we cannot tell, nor is itneedful we should; enough for us to know thatthese exertions shall ultimately be crowned withsuccess, and that the more faithfully we labor, themore speedily we triumph. Perhaps some may he ready to answer our appealsby pointing to the men of America as thosewho must work out its deliverance,—to such wewould say,— We ask not woman to leave her 'appropriatesphere.' Had its duties been properly discharged,your country would not now have been disgracedby slavery. Mothers! there are none so powerfulas you. You have the educating, may we not saythe ruin or salvation of your country in your ownhands. If slavery is to be overthrown by the exertionsof the other sex, then they must be qualifiedfor that work; selfish dispositions must besubdued; exalted ideas of liberty, and sacred regardfor the rights of humanity, must be implanted;and from where, may we expect such a race ofmen, if not from the nurseries of your land. Letyour own souls become filled with generous emotions;let your lullaby to your little infants be thesong of liberty; let your fireside talk be of thewrongs of bondage and the blessings of freedom;by your own lives impress upon the willing mindsof your offspring, lofty conceptions of duty, andcreate within them a longing desire to vindicatethe liberties of your land;—be thus faithful to yoursacred trust, and soon may that spirit which inscribedon the escutcheon of your country, that 'allare born free and equal,' wake up from the slumberof ages, breaking every yoke and letting theoppressed go free.
