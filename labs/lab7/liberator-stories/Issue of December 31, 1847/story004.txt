 Pending the late negotiations between our commissionerand the Mexican Government, the latterinstructed her commissioners to make the following,one among other terms in the treaty, namely:'The United States shall engage not to permitslavery in any part of the territory acquired fromMexico.' Mark who have the reputation among theirneighbors of being the advocates and extenders ofslavery. The people who boast themselves thefreest nation under heaven, outstrip every othertribe or people, Catholic or barbarian, in their zealto disseminate the curses of slavery. If you givethem new territory, you cannot trust them to clotheit with the beauty and glory of free institutions andfree men. You must bind them by treaty, lest theyblast it with the blight of slavery. Yet this is thenation which is seen craving the pity of sister nationsas having been unfortunately doomed to theinheritance of slavery from her birth! One day she bemoans the ills and curses of slaveryand her own bitter lot; anon she rocks thecontinent and immolates hecatombs of her bravesons in war, that she may seize on whole provinces,from which to chase away Liberty, and makeroom therein for more American Slavery! And many of the profound statesmen of ourUnion deem this the glorious mission of the Americanpeople! Our high destiny—in their view—isthe withstand the free spirit or the age and rush tothe rescue of Oppression. The foul spirit of servileoppression has few in all the earth to stand inher behalf, to push her claims, and enlarge herarea; let Americans heed the summons and hasteto her rescue! So our Mexican neighbors estimate our character,and who can arraign them for slander? We are ashamed for our country, and scarcelyknow whether most to blush for her hypocrisy, orfor her ineffable meanness and guilt.
