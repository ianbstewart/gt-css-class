 Extract from an Address to the Naturalized Citizensof Massachusetts, by the Massachusetts CentralSociety,— O.A. Brownson, President, T.D. M' Gee,Secretary :— You will permit us, follow-citizens, to remind youthat, in becoming naturalized, you take an oath offidelity to the Union. That oath, we need not tellour Catholic friends, prohibits you from supporting inany way, inaner, or shape, any party whose policyis based in disloyalty to the Union, or whose action its stability. The first political duty ofevery American citizen is the preservation of theUnion, for no social evil can be so great as would bethe evils resulting from its dissolution. We havenothing to say here of domestic slavery as it existsat the South, but let it be as great an evil as is pretended,its removal would be dearly purchased bythe dissolution of the American Union, and its continuedagitation at the North, in the judgment ofwiser men than we are, cannot but result in that dissolution.We cannot conceive it possible, then, forany loyal citizen to support any party that insists oncontinuing that agitation.
