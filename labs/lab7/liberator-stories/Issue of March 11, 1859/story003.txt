 THE TRACT CAUSE AT THE SOUTH. It is gratifyingto notice, as we do frequently through our Southernexchanges, the evident interest that is felt in theAmerican Tract Society, at the South, and the effortsmade there in its behalf. It has earnest supporterseverywhere, and by their liberal contribution duringthe past year, substantial evidence is afforded oftheir just appreciation of its usefulness and adaptedto the necessities of the people, and of the esteemin which it is held by good men generally.The wishes of the Society in abiding by its conservativeplatform of thirty-three years successful expenseis conspicuous. Rev. J. Cross, agent ofthe Society, has just returned from Charleston, S.C.were he has raised in ten days the handsome sumof $3,210 in cash and pledges, to carry on the workin that State. Other States have also contributedvery liberally. The newspaper in all parts of theSouth, from Maryland to Louisiana, is earnest in itsappeal to the people for aid, and from, present indications,the next annual Report will show a large increaseof receipt over those of any former year.  Theabandonment of the Society by the Abolitionistsseems to have been the signal for increase activityand liberty on the part of its friends. They willnot let it suffer.â€”Journal of Commerce, HE RACT AUSE AT THE OUTH. Journal of Commerce
