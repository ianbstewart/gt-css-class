Afternoon session. The meeting was called toorder at quarter before 3' o' clock, and the proceedingswere intruded by an anti-slavery song from a volunteerchoir, as was the case with nearly everysubsequent session. The president, on motion, appointed the followingpersons a committee to report a list of officers of theSociety for the ensuing year:— Edmund Quincy,Bourne Sponger, William Ashby, Joshua t. Everett,John T. Hilton, Elias Richard, John Bailey, E. WTwinge. Wendell Phillips, from the Business Committee,reported the following resolutions:— 1. Resolved, That surprised as we sure at the simplicityof the Northern press and Northern membersof Congress, in urging so incessantly upon Southerndisunions that their course will defect theirobject, since in the union and under the constitutionis the only security for the permanence and quietenjoyment so slave property, we are still more disgustedat the unblushing impudence with which these sameeditors and politicians rise from their servile knees toask of the abolitionists the support of that veryinstrument which they have just proved to be the cornerstone of bondage, and a comfort to the oppressor. 2. Resolved, That we look upon it as one source ofrejoicing even in its overthrow seems destined to wakento life the torpid conscience of the nation, toquicken its sense of justice, and to recall pure religionto the desecrated temples and whiter sepulcherswhich have so long passes for its shrines. 3. Resolved, that one chief reason why we enterour rebuke against the church is, that having solong scattered the seeds of reform, she sits still, nowthat the fields are white for the harvest; that she]disowns the principles which have sprung from herbosom, brands them as infidel, and gathers into herfold those timid sheep, whom she can still govern,rest they web corrupted by the 'running to and fro, andincrease of knowledge' which her prophets have foretold;that, claiming to have a on the breastplate ofrighteousness, she refuses to have any thing to do withthe battle; claiming to hold the sword of the Spirit,she keeps it nicely sheathed, while other man contendfor the faith once delivered to the saints; and in viewof these facts we pronounce her claim to be theChurch of Christ an idle blasphemy. 4. Resolved, That, in view of the anti-slavery progresso the past year, it must be matter of surprise toall coming time, that in a nation sprung from Englishand Puritan ancestry, the political arena should bethe first to awaken to its duty on a great moral question,and that an agitation like that of anti – slaveryshould owe its progress and success far more to theforum than the pulpit, to the selfish broils and timeservingmotions at Washington, than to those whoassume to fill the pulpits of cooper and Mayhew, andto teach the Gospel of Christ. 5. Resolved, That we look on the present session ofCongress as the most useful since the organization ofthe Government, and consider its character thee resultnot only of the virtue and independence of a fewleading minds there. But of that awakened publicopinion of the free States, of which Washington isbut the echo; and this conviction gives fresh animationto the zeal with which we set ourselves again tothe work of re- educating a corrupt ad besotted people. 6. Resolved, That we seek a dissolution of thisunion, first as a measure of individual duty to ceaseform sustaining a great evil; secondly, to secure freeaction and expression for that degree of anti- slaveryfeeling which even now exists in the nation, andwhich either soothed by the pride, cajoled by theprofessions, or intimidated by power of the greatnational parties and seat; thirdly, by abstaining fromall guaranties to the master to leave tee balance evenbetween the two races; fourthly, to bring closer tothe southern conscience the indignation and moralrebuke of the age, now confused and restrained by afusion of these states; and lastly, to bring to bear onthe institution of slavery those principles of the relativevalue of the free and slave labor, of the unchangeableconnection of national prosperity with popularprogress and the elevation of the masses, which hasswept chattels from Europe, and will put end toin here whenever the break water of the union, whichnow shields the south from their reach, is removed. 7. Resolved, That in the lamented death of DavidRoles, we mourn the loss of an early, active, sagaciousand persevering friend of the anti- slaverycause— of one whose professional ability makes hisdecease a public loss, and whose position and successwere doing much to weaken the cruel prejudiceagainst color— of one whose career proves the powerof individual intellect and energy in making their wayunder the most trying disadvantages of race and position,and of personal infirmity and ill- health; and thatWe command the conduct and character of Dr. Gurglesto the vigor of a pro-slavery community, as evidenceof the vigor of race born down by so manyburdens, and to our colored friends as a model, theimitation of which cannot fail to secure their elevationand improvement. PARKED PILLSSURY spoke to the first resolution,and made some very forcible and instructive remarkson the duties of abolitionists at home, and in theirdaily intercourse with those around them. ARKED ILLSSURY EDMCND QUINCY followed in an able speech. Thefollowing outline of it we take from the Boston Eveningtraveler: DMCND UINCY Boston Eveningtraveler: He thought there was no reason why abolitionistsshould despond. Who should be proud, if not abolitionists?What class of men has made such animpression upon the community? Has not the systemof religious revivals nearly gone into decay? This isthe triumph of the Abolition agitation; not realreligion, but that religion which passes by on the othersaid, the sufferer of the wall. Barer since, he said,we have  to  every as a notion,our religious his delivered. He the days catering of  has this copies whichbound has to support array, there was not a preslaverywinder to be land. Is these days, givingslaves could as spoors be recovered than a fugitivesHungarian or S now. Unfortunately, far furthersCommon of to left their proved situation for aLaw paltry commercial advantages obtained by theUnion of the states; and, since that, religion hasDeclined, because since then, religion sensitizes haveBeen trying to get rid of the question, not to abolishThe system. The spirit of the pipit in this typesets ofThe evolutions was right. What is it now. Why,That they recognize the legal right of the master to hisSlaves, and that nothing should be done to disturbThe peace of the States. The men of the ResolutionWere not already to disturb the peace of the states byTheir own or the cannot mouth. Abolitionists areNot , nor probably ever will be, but thereAre enough to keep on everlasting protest againstSlavery. Out Business is to continually ring the bellAnd be showing up the rottenness of the system; thatIn consequence of it, there is less religion and less loveOf liberty than when country was under the ruleOf George the third. We have been doing this forTwenty years; then there was but one man in favorOf immediate emancipation; and how many are thereNow? Ten it was deemed monstrous to call theSlave holders, who came here from the south, thieves,To be classed with those who, in party- coloredGarments, hummer stone upon the opposite side of theRiver; now millions believes in emancipation. TwentyYears ago, several escaped slaves were confined in ourJail at one time, and a coffins of slaves, manacled together,Has been, I am told, marched through. StateStreet, as is now done at Washington. Now the moneyPower of Boston, though not the highest exponentOf liberty, would rise up against such a degradation—Aye,even the living stone of State street would cryOut; and now, also, there is one place in our city thatIs sacred to liberty, and that is our common Jail. WeHave done something in twenty years if we have madeThe jail a temple of liberty; if this hall is not also-Togather free, the jail is. Some slaves have been carriedBack within twenty years, but they have beenKidnapped, and those who did it are liable to go toThe State Prison.       Who has effected this great change in public sentiment,but William Lloyd Garrison and those he hasco0llected around him — Phillips, Douglass, Remind.It was this man who, in 1831, with twelve others, metIn an old school- house, and formed the first Society inFavor of immediate emancipation; we as yet see onlyThe budding blossom of this action; it is destined toBe the true deliverer of the nation from that sin whichHas made us a hissing and a by – word among nations. There has been, he said, an attempt during the pastyear to prevent slavery going any father; to keepit where it is. John P. Hale, the great free Soilchampion, was willing to keep slavery within itspresent limits, but to protect and uphold it there. Thefeeling which brought forth the Free soil party wasthe result of the agitation of the abolitionists; theyare the men who have caused all the present effervescenceupon the slavery question, and though thefree Soil party will die, all that is good in it will liveand be felt in the Councils of the Nation; its memberswill in time reach the right path. The great ginsfatuous with them and with the people has been theConstitution of the United States. One would thinkThat this Constitution was a perfect palladium ofTroy, a Golden Shield of Rome. But some of us haveSeen the men who made it; some were good men,Some bad men, and a great many indifferent. WithoutThe Union, we should have been a confederationOf powerful States, and slavery would have disappearedAt the South as well as at the North. The South has gained every thing by the Union.Though in a large minority, she has an equal representationin the Senate, and more than a properRepresentation in the house, his son awards the NaryAnd the Army, to the exclusion of their portions ofThe Union; and during the whole period of our nationalExistence, save twelve years and some AlexanderMust be found to cut it and us free. WENDELL PHILLIPS referred to the fact that herB. Stanton, once deemed a very model of anti- slaveryFidelity, but who had in 1840 turned his back upon hisOld friends and fellow- workers of the American anti-SlaverySociety, having given himself up to politics,Has been Intel found voting, as a member of the NewYork Senate, to lay an anti- slavery resolution on the tableIn view of such an example of the moral declineOf a deserter, he saw no reason to be either ashamed orDiscouraged at the attitude in which the MassachusettsAnti- Slavery Society stands to- day. to lay an anti- slavery resolution on the table EVENINO SESSION. The Society re- assembled inFateful Hall, the President in the Chair. The resolutionsBefore the society were read by the secretary. SAMUEL MAY, Jr. supported the 5th resolution,referring to the present session of Congress as one ofthe most useful ever held, and said that he coincidedin the sentiment of that resolution most heartily. Forwe have seen, he said, for the first time, any considerablebody of men facing the South, and determinedto make no compromise with them. The genius of the South quailed before that unitedfew, though the North and South united to sweepthem away. It looked hopeful to see this; it seemedas if the strength of the Northern man was comingback to his sinews and his bones. Is this nothing torejoice at? What course will the slaveholder nowpursue? The last news from Washington is, thatMr. Clay is bending the force of his powerful mind toSee how the matter can be compromised; to see if heCan make the power of this great land bow downBefore The Moloch of slavery. This is the way the risingSpirit of freedom in the North is to be bound.We must meet the compromise with the denunciationIt deserves. We must hold up to the scorn andIndignation it merits, the compromising spirit withWrong which prevails through the land, and whichHas been the chief characteristic of the whole politicalLife of that truly American statesman; Henry Clay.And indeed the Constitution of the country, it self aCompromise with the most gigantic wickedness, compelsall who support it be compromisers — to be partnerswith thieves and adulterers, and partakers intheir unhallowed work. No man can swear faith to the Constitution, blackas it is with compromises, without being so corruptedand palsied in his moral ensue as be unable to dothe work of a freeman. Let us then, he said, seek itsdissolution, and go forth from the disgraceful and disgustingpartnership, which finds no parallel on thecivilized or uncivilized earth:— let us come out, ifMassachusetts stands sloe. ROHERT EDMOND, a Scotch gentleman, said hewould like very briefly to describe to the audiencethe treatment he had received in south Carolina forendeavoring to elevate the character of the slavepopulation, and teaching some slaves to read. He hadgone to South Carolina as a baker, but moral conditionof the slaves and colored people, that he thoughthe would attempt some thing for their benefit. Onone occasion, while teaching some slaves to read, aband of men, disguised, came to his school- house,dragged him a mile or more, and there stripped himof his clothes, and covered him with a coat of tar andfeathers, and then ordered him with a coat of tar andfeathers, and then ordered him, on peril of his life, toleave the State without delay. Mr. Edmond expressedthe astonishment he had felt, on coming to theNorth, and visiting different towards and villages forThe purpose of telling his story, to find now muchIndifference exists with regard to the slave's wrongAnd sufferings, and how strong a feeling there is, onthe actor hand, in the slave holder's behalf. He saidto had being slavery discovered at what hew hadexceptional serves the united States, though he single of his own land would headily ardentthe pray he said it hair return.  PAREKES PILLESSAR allowed. He commented onthe  of Mr. Blood. And upon our 'gleamedsaps' with the men who committed thatmean self dastardly attack upon him. The garb in that cowardly bonds had clothed him wasinduced to his a 'robe of right lameness,' of which Mr.E. would ever his  to be asked.    Mr. P. then contrasted, with this treatment of Mr.Emend the treatment which Southern men actually at the North. He referred to the adulationwith which the Boston Alias recently noticed thelina. Mr. Pillsbury then referred to the late letters ofFather Mathew to Judge Lumpkin of Georgia, readThat letter, with all its honeyed sad complimentaryPhrases, and rebuked the servile course which theApostles of Temperance is pursuing in the slaveholding states.   Apostles of Temperance WENDELL PRILLIRS took the case of Mr. Edmondas a lest far as able and ebullient speech, is whichhe portrayed the degrading effects of our slaveholdingalliance. Adjourned to Thursday, 10 o'clock, A.M. THURSDAY, NOV. 24. The Society again met in Fancily Hall, shad Presidentin the Chair. The Secretary read the first resolution. DANINL J. WARRNY, of Hopedale, spoke in supportof the resolutions before the meeting, salvagingupon the compromises with slavery in the U.S. Constitution.THOMAS HASSALS, of Gloucester, else spokeTo the resolutions. The Finance Committee reported the followingresolution for adoption:— Resolved, That the members of this Society, saidother persons in attendance, be requested to COM tributethe sum of one dollar, or such sum, either moreor less, as they may think right, for the purpose ofdefraying the necessary expenses of the meeting. They also gave notices that copies of the AnnualReport would be ready for distribution in the afternoon,And that each person contributing to the expensesOf the meeting would be entitled to a copy. the resolution was adopted. Some remarks were made, specially on the resolutionrelative to David Gurgles, by Wendell Phillipsand John M. Spear, and that resolution (No.7) wasunanimously adopted. PARKED PILLSSURY continued the discussion on theresolutions, alluding to a recent attack, in the Washingtonunion, on the Massachusetts Anti- Slavery society,on account of the Petition it is circulating in favorof secession from the Union. He spoke of thedoubtful and hesitating manner in which than freeSoil party had managed its own affairs; witness theSeven trials in Middlesex District to elect a memberOf Congress, in every one of which the free soilParty has been steadily losing ground, whereas, ifThey had agitated the District faithful and fearlessly,They might have completely triumphed longSince. Mr. Pillsbury also spoke of the effect of theAnti- slavery agitation, wherever thoroughly carried,In unmasking priestly manicuring, and in suppressingThose delusive excitements called religious revivals,In which it is only the pro- slavery religion of thisGuilty land which meets with any revival. ARKED ILLSSURY WENDELL PHILLIPS and PARKER PILLARCRY furthercontinued the discussion on the position and characterof the free soil party. The latter draw a strikingcontrast between the regard for liberty manifestedin this country and in turkey. (!) where, accordingto lieu, Lynch, whom President Polk sent on anexpedition to the Dead Sea, (with a view, as wassuggested, to the animation of  and Genderedon this reception) salaam of the any man to be held in slavery for a period exceedingseven years, and where there is 'no prejudice foundedon distinction of color; 'and the fact is stated that thepresent Governor of the Dardanelles is a black man,and was recently a slave. ENDELL HILLIPS ARKER ILLARCRY animation of  and Genderedon this reception   WILLAM A. WHRRE rose, he said, to bear his testimonyin favor of the Massachusetts Anti- slaverySociety, with its kindred societies, as the only organizationIn the land which goes for the liberation ofEvery slave in the land; and therefore, said he, IHonor the Society, and belong to it. But he did notAgree that the free Soil party is, as Mr. PillsburySaid, the worst of the three, and that its influence isMore to be feared than that of the other two. HeUndertook a defense of that party. Adjourned to 2 1-2 o'clock. AFTERNOON. Met pursuant to adjournment, thePresident in the Chair. Copies of the Annual ReportWere distributed. FTERNOON. G.W.F. MELLEN addressed the Society, andpresented certain resolution as substitutes for thosebefore the meeting. Not being seconded, they were laidon the label. ELLEN CHARLES LIST, Ear., of Boston, a member of theFree Soil party, spoke warmly and eloquently in defenseOf that party, and of his own course in joiningWith it. He claimed for it an anti- slavery character,And that much good had resulted from its labors. HeDeclared himself a believer in expediency as well asIn principle; and said he found himself unable to actAlways on principle, 9as he would be glad to do,) butThat he must, in many cases, be governed by expediency. HARLES IST, Edmund Quincy presented the following resolution:— Resolved, that every one who regards himself anabolitionist is urgently requested to pledge all thathe can give, all he can collect, and all he deems itcertain his town or society will give, to sustain thisSociety in carrying on a series of Conventions withIn this Common wealth, to rouse its catties to theirDuty to the slave. This, after some remarks in its support, was unanimouslyadopted. PARKER PILLSSURY made a very able replay to Mr.List, and especially to the claim he had set up, thatThe free soil party is the party of progress. WhatKind of progress is that. He asked, which goes, in itsList of Presidential candidates, from James g. Barney,A repentant slaveholder, and long a most efficientLaborer in the anti- slavery cause, back to John P. Hale,A man who openly, in the senate, declares him selfReady to fulfill all the Constitutional guaranties toSlavery, and to shed his heart's best blood rather thanNot fulfill them; and, again, from john P. Hale backTo martin Van Buren, the cunning and inveterate feelOf anti- slavery, the man who, in 1840. pledged himself,If elected to the Presidency, to votes any bill forThe abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia;This is progress, with a vengeance! ARKER ILLSSURY SAMUKL MAY, JR., with leave, stated to the audiencethe case of Alexander Asher, a fugitive slavefrom Cuba, recently arrived in this city, by the wayof Nova Scotia. The case elicited much sympathy,and several persons pledged themselves to aid himto find employment, and the heedful Sid meanwhile. Adjourned to the avenging, 7 O'clock. evening. Met according adjournment, EdmundQuincy, a vice President, in the Chair. SAMUML MAY, Jam., said thought neither a prophet northe son of a prophet, he would venture to say, thetime was not far distant when it would be regardedas one of the greatest glories of Annuli Hall, one ofthe best and most appropriates uses to which it hadover been pat, that it had been the place where, insmokiest years, the fugitive slave, man and woman,successfully escaping from every part of the SouthernStates, had copies, and had received a hearty andMost sheering welcome.

What do you mean by theHow many of you, who have just uttered that have, within the past year,  to support the situation of the United States, either directly through those you have elected to represent you to take the oath in your name? By the very the Constitution, Massachusetts and all her (who have not repudiated  to the Government) are held and bound to on that thing which every man in Fanenil Hall so-night asdeclared  WILL NOT DO. And are you gang perjured men? Will you continue to support a situation which requires sets of you, against which everydictate of your consciences and every of your natures rebels?

What is youprofessed sympathy for the outraged slave. When towhole force of your influence and example is theyinto the scale of his oppressor?                     Mr. Quincy addressed himself to the Free Reminded them of the manner in which their The Hon. Samuel Hoar, had been ejected from Carolina, and said he, if you cannot, or come up to our ground of 'No Union with I call on you to show at last as much sprint as South Carolina; meet her on her own ground With her own weapons. When the fugitive comes to Massachusetts, demand that he pr she stead of hiding away in secret, shall be openly into the State-house, there to receive the of the Governor and the assembled and when the slaveholder comes here, on has soul-hunting business, shut him up in the jail; and if he repeats his visit, make it a State offence, for life. This (to the Free-Spoilers) bound to do, in consistency with your men if Massachusetts acting under the Government. But there is higher ground that mere retaliation. And it is to this higher grouses summon you—yes, all of you, every man, every man, every child of Massachusetts—namely to from all support of slavery, to repudiate the which requires it of you, and to living, practical motto, 'NO UNION WITH SLALTHOLDERS!'     No Union with                      [Mr. Quincy's speech, (which, with many ought to have been reported in full,) though it aswith little favor from some in the hall, and made them wince a good deal, was jet receivedconstant applause, and evidently took good offer.]    Mr. Quincy was followed by WENDELL PHILLITS in a speech of great Which appealed to every just, every kindly and rous sentiment of the heart. He made the the slave-girl (who sat by the side of the throughout) his theme, and well did he illustrate byit the nature of our Federal Union with theslaveholding States. But we can give no report an outline, even. ENDELL HILLITS      EDMUND Quincy offered the following resolution:—8.Resolved, That the Board of Managers of Society be instructed, In its name and on its memorialize the British Government, the case and conduct of George Washington Her Majesty's Col for Wilmington, N.C., is Lotion to American Slavery, and requesting his al from that office as an set demanded by the of Civilization, the voice of Humanity, and the if the Empire DMUND          The resolution was adopted with only one  voice.

WENDELL PNILLIPS, from the Business CommitteesReported the following resolution:— ENDELL NILLIPS, 9. Resolved, That we record with sadness the totalwant of consistency of conduct, frankness and in   Dependence on the part of Father MTHEW in relationto slavery; that every one must see his severaland fawning letter to judge Lumpkin sets theseal to all we inferred or feared from his interviewwith Mr. Garrison; and that if any one then thoughtour language severs and exaggerated, such mustacknowledge now that his 'rising genius has sinned upTo our song'; and that though we confess that Americanslavery, conversed with the blood of a hundred, and the cypress of as many victories, hasover achieved a more palpable and disgraceful onethan when she chained the illustrious Father to hercar, still we rejoice to know that when he sacrificedhis conviction to selfish case and usurious Tempence,he rung away the love and confidence of milieu;that the prospects of the system of human bondage;are so dark, that the brightest fame is eclipsedwhen it sinks in to the first of that embrace; and thatthe slimed and recreant Apostle of one Reform liesthere of all his influence in the lap of his Delilah.  Rev. Jess L. Russell of Hingham addressed theSuavely, pointing out the reasons which the abolitionTo have for encouragement and for persevering in theWork which, through their instrumentality, has beenWhere so successfully carried forward. L. Masochisms, of Philadelphia, spoke atconsiderable length, and with much earnestness and effect.He spoke of the high satisfaction he had experiencedOur meetings, and especially in the meeting of thePrevious evening; and them went in to a carefulExamination of the character of the free soil party.He showed that a separate political party is needlessTo accomplish anti- slavery work, and pointed out theS steps which had been taken, and triumphsWas, in Pennsylvania, without the intervention ofSay political party, but to which both the greatPartial has been compelled, by the anti- slavery feelingIn the people, to contribute. We regret our inabilityTo give a full repose of Mr. Me kin's address.  PERES PLESSEY offered the following Resolution:– ERES LESSEY To Resolved, that if any thing be wanting toperfect this nations character as the most gigantic andunblushing hypocrite that ever deserved the universalexcretion of the world, it is most abundantlysupplied in the pretended sympathy for the fallen Hungers,now so disgustingly poured forth from theshallower lips of Zachary Taylor, Lewis Cass,Pained Webster, and other representation of this nationWhose tyrannies and crimes are unparalleled inThe history of all the Austrians and Russia of theOld World; and we can not but believe, that if HungaryKnows no more of true Liberty than to ask or acceptThe sympathies of such overgrown tyrants, sheHad far better return to her allegiance to Austria,Until a longer submission shall have better fitted her forIts enjoyment. since Mad, Jr. offered the following:— H. Resolved, That, admiring the fearlessness, thefidelity to principle, and the just discernment of slavery'strue nature and its chief strong holds, manifestedby that great Convention of Ohio's sons anddaughters, assembled in September last at Berlin intest State, we, the members and friends of the Massachusettsanti- slavery Society, assembled in Annulihall, do cordially respond to their words, and saywith then, 'with full confidence in the integrity ofour purpose and the justice of our cause, who DOMESSEY DECEAEE OCAELIES THE ENEMIES OF THECONSTITUTION, UNION AND GOVERNMENT OF THEUNITED STATED, and the friends of a New ConfidenceOf States, where there shall be N UNIONWITH SLAVEHOLDERS, but where there shallAre be Free SOIL, FREE LABOR, AND FREEMEN, And we proclaim it as our unalterablePaper and determination to live and to labor for aDissolutions of the present Union by all LAWEUL andRear, though BLOODLESS and PACIFIC MEANS, and forThe formation of a NEW REPUBLC, that shall beSuch, not in name only, but in fall, living reality andTroth.

Edmund Quincy continued the appealand infrared the previous remarks. EWIS ORD, Rev. THEODORE PARKER came forward, and wasreceived with warm applause.

ENDELL HILLIPS [we hope to give the remarks of both thesegentlemen, written out by themselves, next week.] At the conclusion of Mr. Phillips remarks, theSociety adjourned to 7 o'clock. EVENING SESSION. Meting called to order by thePresident, and an anti- slavery ado song. VENING ESSION. THOMAS JOHES, (once a slave in Williams, N.C.,) again addressed the meeting, he said he had oftenheard that William Lloyd Agrarian and his friendstalked against religion. But since he had heard andknown them for himself, he found it was not as. Hefound Mr. Garrison teaching a religion which locatedlove to god and love to man, and he thoughtWm. Lloyd Garrison and his friends had got the bestchurch he knew of anywhere. Mr. Garrison and hischurch had taken compassion on the poor, ignorant anddegraded slave, had remember him in his bounds, inhis sufferings, in his hungers, in his thirst, nod hadshown their love fore god, whom they have not seem,by loving their brother whom they have seen. I wasa Preacher to my people, said T. Jones, and I don'tlike to say too much against my brother of the clergy,but the truth must be told, and it is true that thechurches almost every where have shut their doorsagainst the slave and his cause, and goose into unionwith their oppressors. Now I call upon all of youWho profess Christianity, to show your religion byloving your brethren in bonds. HOMAS OHES, WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON then came upon theplatform. [It was the first time Mr. Garrison hadspoken, having been kept by illness from the previousmeetings, and he was greeted with heartycheers.] ILLIAM LOYD ARRISON At the close of your glorious anti- slavery cars painin Fateful Hall, he said, I present my self before you,not as I should like to do, but as I can — in a crippledcondition, yet not crippled by any of the dartsof pro- slavery, for none of them have ever reachedme; crippled as to bodily health, [Mr. Q. then laboringunder a spinal difficulty,] but still having a goodback- bone to my anti- slavery. I admire, and wouldimitable, the example of that indomitable combatant,of whom it is recorded that, after the amputation ofhis legs, he 'fought upon his stumps.' Pleasantry aside — I feel that, after you have hadbefore you a fugitive slave, to rehearse in your earsthe story of his wrongs and sufferings, and to pleadfor the deliverance of the millions who are still groaningin bondage, it would be presumptuous for anyother person to follow him, whatever might be thepower of his logic or the force of his eloquence, withthe expectation of deepening the impression alreadymade upon your hearts. A chattelized human beingis the best advocate of his own cause, however betokenhis dialect. As to the encomiums so profusely bestowed uponme by the fugitive friend who has just sat down, Iaccept them from that quarter as coming from a sincereand grateful heart. But if any are apprehensivethat I may get 'exalted above measure' by such flatteringallusions, let them remember the exhaustlessstream of above and misrepresentation that isconstantly poured upon my head, To keep an evenbalance of this occasion, I will present the other side ofthe picture. A few days since, I want to the Portland todelivered the anti- slavery lecture. A friend of mine, inthat city, anxious that a certain member of an Orthodoxchurch should hear it, invited him to be present.' If it were in my power,' replied this evangelicalprofessor, 'I would kick William Lloyd Garrison sofar beyond hell, that even the devil himself wouldnot be able to find him!' (Laughter,) 'The nexttime you see that benevolent man,' said I to myfriend, 'tell him I am greatly obliged to him for wish to brbeyond hell, where the devil can never find me — forthat surely must be in a heavenly state.' (Shouts ofLaughter.) I am sorry to say that when this pleasantTurn to his inconsiderate speech was communicated toThat 'orthodox' brother, instead of touching hisMagnanimity, he answered with great malignity of feeling'I wish I could kick the middle of hell,'that thus my eternal damnation might be made certain!(Strong sensation throughout the assembly.)So much for compliment and denunciation; Within the last three or four years, extra ordinarypains have been taken throughout the country,—fromthe occupant of the Presidential chair down tothe occupant of the pulpit — to eulogize the AmericanUnion as something worthy to be hallowed to theLatest posterity. The cause of this unusual display ofRegard for that 'covenant with death,' and that'agreement with hell,' is seen in the significant fact,that LIBERTY and HUMANITY are with increasing earnestnessand power demanding its immediate dissolution.Among those who have lately come to therescue of the Union, I am sorry to say, is the giftedpoet LONGFELLOW, some of whose best effusions havebeen in sympathy with the fettered slave (God neveryet having given to slavery a poet,) but who has nowProstituted his fine genius in praise o that which isCrushing the population to the earth. Mr. Garrison here read the following Apostropheto the Union, from a volume of Longfellow's Poems,just issued from the press:— Thou, too, sail on, O ship of state!Sail on, O union, strong and great!Humanity, with all its fears,With all the hopes of future years,Is hanging breathless on thy fate!We know what master laid thy kill,What workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,Who made each mast, each sail, each rope,What anvils rang, what hammers beat,In what a forge and what a heatWere shaped the anchors of thy hope!Fear not each sudden sound and shock,This of but the flapping of the sail,And not a net made by the gate!In spite of rock and tempest roar,In spite of false lights on the shore,Sail on, our fear to breast the sea!Our hearts, our hopes, are all with three;Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,Are all with thee — are all with thee!                     These lines were read by Mr. Garrison as emphaticallyas though they were really his own sentiments— thus doing full justice to their artistic skill andbeauty — the galleries applauding with special animation.] If, Mr. Chairman, this tribute were only 'a poet'slicense,' and so understood — if it implied nothingmore than a graceful flight of fancy — it would notchallenge criticism; but this was not its design, andwill not be its effect on the popular mind. Alreadyit has been published far and wide in the newspapers,and no where with more sacristy than at the South.Now, sir, its description of the formation of the Unionis not only a poetical extravagance, but absolutely atvariance with historical verity. That Union wasformed in utter derogation of all the principles ofjustice, humanity and righteousness — solely by theimmolation of one sixth portion of the population on thestar of slavery — and through the most guiltycompromises. As affirming its real character and presentcondition, I propose, for the adoption of this Society,the following resolution:– Resolved, That it is with deep regret we perceivethat the poet LONOFELLOW has prostituted his finepoetical genius to eulogize the blood – stained AmericanUnion as freighted with the hopes and interests of Humanity —asbeing a noble ship, invulnerable tothe flock and proof against the storm, builtin the most skillful and workmanlike manner; whereas, the history of its creation and its cruisedemonstrates it to have beam— ——a perfidious bark, Built I' the' eclipse, and rigged with curses dark'—rottingthough all her timbers, leaking from stemto stern, laboring heavily on a storm – tossed sea,surrounded by clouds of disastrous portent, navigatedby those whose object is a piratical one, (namely, theextension and perpetuity of slavery,) and destinedto go down,' full many a fathom deep,' to the joyand exultation of all who are yearning for thedeliverance of a groaning world. [The reading of the resolution complicated suchapples singled with hisses.] There appears is be access different of spices inthis simultaneously, is regarded to the resolution just read; butI hold another resolution in my hand, which I willsubmit to the accosting, and which I am were will beresponded to more automatically, It reels to thatparsons anther and distinguished addressed of sufferinghumanity, G Thorough of England,(landappellation,) sad is as follows:—  Resolved, That from Fantail Hall the masteredanti- slavery Society sends forth its congratulationto GEORGE THOMPSON, representation ofthe Tower Hamlets in the British Parliament, and therepresentative of the down- Trodden of all nations inthe aroma of Humanity, at the promise and the prospectof his visiting the United States in the sourceof the present year — morning him of a warm andenthusiastic reception on the part of thousands andtens of thousands of the friends of nonverbal principles,multitudes of whom have been converted to thecause of the slave since he was drives from theseshores by operatic violence, and who years for thehour to arrive when they may have both the opportunityand the privilege to do honor to the manwhom they once, in their blindness or passion, wereled to despise or persecute. ['Three cheers for George Thompson,' aborted avenerable friend in the body of the house, and theywere given by the large assembly with great enthuseslams. Three additional cheers were given afterwardson the adoption of the resolution. After makingsome father reference to the services and merits ofMr. Thompson, Mr. Garrison proceeded:— In the course of your proceedings, Mr. Chairman,congratulation have been offered, very justly, bysome of the speakers, in regard to what has beenalready, achieved in behalf of the anti- slavery cause.Most encouraging indeed has been our success; wehave overcome a thousand formidable obstacles, andtrodden beneath our feet ten thousand soul- tryingdifficulties, and vanquished innumerable perils; we havecarried one outpost after another of the enemy, tillthe citadel alone remains to be taken. In proof ofthis, I will read an extract from a recent editorialarticle in Bennett's New York herald — a paper bribedto the support of slavery — a paper which has neveryet allowed an anti- slavery meeting to be held in thecity of new York without grossly caricaturing itsproceedings — a paper which has uniformly representedthe abolitionists as an insignificant and contemptiblefaction. Here what the Herald now says!] [The article, for which we have not room in thisconnection, traces all the difficulties in Congress, andin every legislature, North and South, to 'the antislaveryagitation' — and declares — 'The abolitionistshave driven the Whigs and democrats before them,like slaves under the lash of the whipper- in.* * *All other issues are forgotten. Tariffs, bank, internalimprovements, every old issue that has divided parties,is now buried in oblivion, and it is nothing butfree soil, abolition, into- slavery, now, What is to bethe result of such a state of things?* * * A separationand dissolution of this glorious Union.' Forall which, said Mr. Garrison, God be thanked!(Cheers and hisses.) Mr. Garrison confessed that all this was a flatteringview of the progress of the cause; but as for himself,he felt more inclined to forget the things that are behind,the trials and the triumphs of the past, and topress onward to the mark — the other extinction ofAmerican slavery. How much remained to be accomplishedWas seen in the fact, that there was not, afterTwenty tears of persevering effort, one single villageIn the country, however small its population, thatWas thoroughly imbued with the anti- slavery spirit;That there was not an anti- slavery pulpit or churchThat has a reputable character; and that the leadersIn Church and State are still with the oppressor. OnwardThen hand to hand and heart to heart! PARKER PILLSSURY took the platform. He read theresolution on American sympathy Hungary, andpreceded to show how  it is,especially when coming from slaveholders and theirabettors, from Zachary Taylor and Lewis Cass andtheir like. He read also the address lately madeto President Taylor, at Washington, by General Unhurt,one of the Hungarian exiles, and said if the fulsomeand disgusting flattery with which that address issurcharged, is any just exponent of the feelings andideas of the Hungarians generally, they are utterlyunfit for freedom, and well do they merit the deafestand sufferings which have come upon them.  WENDELL PHILLIPS made the closing speech, amost eloquent one, and frequently interrupted bycheers. He reviewed some of the notable events inthe history of the anti- slavery cause in Boston, fromthe time when Harrison Gray Otis sneeringly saidthat he heard that the abolitionists, in their madness,put the Bible above the Statute- book; he alluded tothe time when Peleg Sprague stood in Fateful Halland tried to awaken sympathy with the South bypointing up to the portrait of Washington, and callinghim 'that slaveholder'; he did not omit to callto mind Richard Fletcher's base attempts to propitiatethe South, nor the encouragement given to themurderers of Lovejoy, (at Alton,) by 'that infamousAtomic- General, James Tectonic Austin.' HeProceeded to show what had its position and attitudeOf the churches in Boston in the same period.Where, he asked, was Hubbard Winslow?Teaching that a minister's rule of duty, as to what heShould teach and preach, is 'what the brotherhoodWill allow and protect,' Where is the pulpit of theOld South; Sustaining slavery as a Bible institution.Where is Park street Church; Refusing toReceive within its walls, for funeral service, the bodyOf the only Matter which the Orthodox CongregationalistsOf New England have had, Charles T. Turkey,And of whom they were not worthy*. AndWhere is Federal street Church; Teaching thatLicense is the mission of the North with respect toSlavery, and closing its doors to the funeral eulogy ofFallen, the bosom friend of the only man who willMake Federal street pulpit to be remembered, WilliamEllery Chinning. And I might ask, he said,Where are the New South and Brattle street, — butThey are not. ENDELL HILLIPS * [The above is but a sketch of the commencementof Mr. P.'s speech,— we must leave the remainderuntouched.] SAMUEL MAY, JR., moved that the question be nowtaken on the resolutions, (upon which no vote hadpreviously been had,) taking up the resolutionrespecting GEOROE THOMPSON separately. The motionwas adopted. AMUEL AY, R., The resolution respecting Mr. Thompson was thenadopted by acclamation. The question being then taken upon the otherresolutions, they were adopted. The Society thane adjourned, sine die. N.B. During the first day of the meeting, theattendance was not so large as on previous years, probablynot exceeding 600 in the day, and double thatnumber5 in the evening. But the attendance rapidlyincreased on the second day, and the remainder of themeetings were like those of the old time, and worthyof the cause, very large and enthusiastic. The Finance Committee reported about onethousand dollars pledged to the Society, and payableduring the year, and over two hundred dollars paid in forexpenses and as donations. In addition to this, thesum of thirty- three dollars was collected for the slavegirl, Betsy Blakely. FRANCIS JACKSON, President. President. SAMUEK MAY, JR., AMUEK AY, R., Secretaries. ELIRA J.
