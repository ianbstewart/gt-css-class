Roberts us. The city of Boston— before theSupreme court of Massachusetts, Dec. 4, 1849. [CONCLUDED.] there are some other matter not strictly belongingto the juridical aspect of the case, and yet ofimportance to its clear comprehension, upon which Ishall touch briefly before I close. It is sometimes said, in extenuation of the presentsystem in Boston, that the separation of the white andblack children was originally made at the request ofthe colored parents. This is substantially true. Itappears from the interesting letter of Dr. Belknap, inreply to Judge Tacker's queries respecting slaveryin Massachusetts, written at the close of the last century,(4 Mass. Hist. Coll., 207,) that at that time nodiscrimination on account of color was made in thepublic schools of Boston. 'The same provision.' Hesays, 'is made by the public for the education of thechildren of the blacks, as for those of the whites. Inthis town, the committee who superintend the freeschools have given in charge to the schoolmasters toreceive and instruct black children as well as white.'Dr. Belknap adds, however, that he has not heard ofMore than three or four who have taken advantageOf this privilege, though the number of blacks inBoston probably exceeds one thousand. It is to beFeared that the in human bigotry of caste— said relicOf the servitude from which they had just escaped;— was at this time too strong to allow colored childrenkindly welcome in the free schools, and thatfrom dity and ignorance, they shrank from takingtheir places on the same benches with thewhite children. Perhaps the prejudice against themwas so inveterate that they could not venture to asserttheir rights. It appears, that in 1800 a position waspresented to the School Committee from sixty-six coloredpersons, praying for the establishment of aschool for their benefit, Private munificence cameto the aid of the city, and the present system ofseparate schools was brought in to being.  These facts are interesting in the history of theBoston Schools, but they cannot in any way affectThe rights of the colored people, or the powers of theCommittee. These rights and these powers stand onThe constitution and laws of the common wealth.Without adopting the suggestion of Jefferson, thatOne generation cannot by legislation bind itsSuccessors, all must agree that the assent of a few percents,Nearly half a century ago— at a time whenTheir rights were imperfectly understood— to anConstitutional and illegal course, cannot alter theConstitution and the laws, and bind their descendantsFor ever in the thrall of caste. Nor can theCommittee derive from this assent, or from any lapseOf tome, powers in derogation and Of the rights of man. it is clear that the sentiments of the colored peoplehave now changed. The present case, and thedeep interest which they manifest in it, throngingthe court to hung on this discussion, attest thechange. With increasing knowledge, they havelearned to know their rights, and to feel the degradationto which they have been doomed. Theirpresent effort is the taken of a manly character, whichthis court will cherish and respect. The spirit ofPoal now revives in them, even as when he said'' I am a Roman citizen.' But it is said that these separate schools are for themutual benefit of children of both colors, and of thePublic Schools. In similar spirit, slavery is comeTimes said to be for the mutual benefit of master andSlave, and of the country where it exists. In oneCase, there is a mistake as great as in the other.This is clear. Nothing unjust, nothing ungenerous,Can be for the benefit of any person, or any thing.Shortsighted mortals may hope to draw from someSeeming selfish superiority, or from a gratified vanityOf class, a permanent good; but even- handed justicebukes these efforts, and with certain power redressedThe wrong. The whites themselves are injuredBy the separation. Who can doubt this; with theLaw as their monitor, they are taught to regard aPortion of the human family, children of god, createdIn his image, co-equals in his love, as a separateAnd degraded class— they are taught practicallyTo deny that grand revelation of Christianity— theBrotherhood of Mankind. Their hearts, while yetTender with childhood, are necessarily hardened byThis conduct, and their subsequent lives, perhaps,Bear enduring testimony to this legalized uncharita-bleness.Nursed in the sentiment of Caste, receivingIt with the earliest food of knowledge, they areUnable to eradicate it from their natures, and thenWeakly and impiously charge upon their HeavenlyFather the prejudice which they have continue toEmbody and perpetuate in their institutions. TheirCharacters are debased, and they become less fit forThe magnanimous duties of a good citizen.  The Helots of Sparta were obliged to intoxicatethemselves, that they might teach to the children oftheir masters the deformity of intemperance. Inthus sacrificing one class to the other, both weredegraded— the imperious Spartan, and the debasedHelot. But it is with a similar double-edged injusticeThat the School committee of Boston have prejudiceOr fancied advantage of the white. It is fit that a child should be taught to shuntwickedness, and, as he is yet plastic to receiveimpressions, to shun wicked men. Horace was right.When, speaking of a person morally wrong, false andUnjust, he called him black, saying. —'his, niger, est, hunc tu, Romanc, caveto.The Boston Committee adopt the warning, but applyIt, not to those black in heart, but only black inSkin. They forget the admonition addressed to theProphet: 'But the Lord said unto Samuel, look notOn his countenancer, for the Lord seeth not as manSeeth: for man looketh at the outward appearance,but the load looketh at the heart.' (I. Sam. 16:7.) look notOn his countenancer, for the Lord seeth not as manSeeth: for man looketh at the outward appearance, Who can say, that this does not injure the blacksTheir, in its best estate, is an unhappy lot ShatOut by a still lingering prejudice from many socialAdvantages, a despised class, they feel this proscriptionFrom the Public Schools as a peculiar brand.Beyond this, it deprives them of those heal h b, ani-Matinginfluences which would come from a participationIn the studies of their white brethren. It addsTo their discouragements. It widens their separationFrom the rest of the community, and postponeThat great day of reconciliation which is sure toCome. The whole system of Public Schools suffers also.It is a narrow perception of their high aim whichLeaches that they are merely to furnish to all theScholars an equal amount in knowledge, and that,Therefore, provided all be taught, it is of little cones-Quincewhere, and in what company it be done.The law contemplates not only that they shall all beLaugh, but that they shall be taught all to gather.They are not only to receive equal quantities ofKnowledge, but all are to receive it in the same way.All are to approach together the same commonFountain; nor can there be any exclusive sources forAny individual or any class. The school is the littleWorld in which the child is trained for the largerWorld of life. It must, therefore, cherish andDevelop the virtues and the sympathies which areEmployed in the larger world. And since, according toOur institutions, all classes must, without distinctionOf color, in the performance of civil duties, so shouldThey all meet, without detection of color, in theSchool, beginning there those elations of equalityWhich our constitution and precise to all. taught all to gather. As the State receives strength from the unity andsolidarity of its citizens, without distinction of class,so the school receives new strength from the unityand solidarity of all classes beneath its roof. Inthis way, the poor, the humble, and the neglectedshare not only the companionship of their morefavored brethren, but enjoy also the protection of theirpresence, in drawing towards the school a morewatchful superintendence. A degraded or neglectedclass, if left to themselves, will become moredegraded or neglected. To him that hath shall begiven; and the world, true to these words, turnsfrom the poor and outcast to the rich and fortunate.It is the aim of our system of public schools, by theBlending of all classes, to draw upon the whole schoolThe attention which is too apt to be given only to theFavored few, and thus secure to the poor their portionOf the fruitful sunshine. But the colored children,Placed apart by themselves, are deprived of this blessing. Nothing is more clear than that the welfare ofclasses, as well as of individuals, is promoted bymutual acquaintance. The French and English, fora long time regarded as natural enemies, have at last,from a more intimate communion, found themselvesto be natural friends. Prejudice is the child ofignorance. It is sure to prevail where people do notknow each other. Society and intercourse are meansestablished by Providence for human improvementthey remove antipathies, promote mutual adaptationand conciliation, and establish relations of reciprocalregard. Whose sets up barriers to these, the wartsthe ways of providence, crosses the tendencies ofhuman nature, and directly interferes with the lawsof god. May it please your Honors: such are some of thethings which it has occurred to me to say in thisimportant cause. I have occupied much of your time,but I have not yet exhausted the topics. Still, whichway so ever we turn, we are brought back to one singleproposition— the equality of men before the law.this stands as the mighty guardian of the rights ofthe colored children in this case. It is the constant,ever-present, tutelary genius of this common wealth,frowning upon every privilege of birth, upon everydistinction of race, upon every institution of caste.You cannot slight it, or avoid it. You cannot restrainIts. It remains that you should welcome it. Do this,And your words will be a 'character and freehold ofRejoicing' to a race which has earned by muchSuffering a title to much regard. Your judgment willBecome a sacred landmark, not in judgment willBut in the history of freedom, giving preciousEncouragement to all the weary and heavy- linden way-Farersin this great cause. Massachusetts will then,Through you, have a fresh title to regard, and be onceMore, as in times past, an example to the whole land. the equality of men before the law. You have already banished slavery from thiscommon wealth. I call upon you now to obliterate thelast of this footprints, and to banish the last of thehateful spirits in its train, that can be reached by thiscourt. The law interfering to prohibit marriagesbetween blacks and whites, has been abolished bythe Legislature. The railroads which, imitating theBoston school, placed colored people in a car byThem selves, have been compelled, under the influenceOf an awakened public sentiment, to abandon thisRegulation, and to allow them to mingle with otherTravelers. It is only recently that I have read thatHis Excellency. The present Governor of Massachusetts,Took his seat in a car by the side of a negro.It is in the Caste schools of Boston that the prejudiceOf color has sought its final legal refuge. It is forYou to drive it forth. You do well when you rebukeAnd correct individual offences; but it is a higherOffice far to rebuke and correct a vicious institution.Each individual is limited in his influence: but anInstitution has the influence of numbers organizedBy law. The charity of one man may counteractOr remedy the uncharitable ness of another, but noIndividual can counteract or remedy the uncharitable nessOf an established institution. Against it privateBenevolence is powerless. It is a monster whichMust be hunted down by the public, and by its constitutedAuthorities. And such is the institution ofCaste in the public schools of Boston, which nowAwaits its just condemnation from a just Court. The civilization of the age joins in this appeal.It is well known that this prejudice of color is peculiarTo our country. You have not forgotten that twoYouths of African blood only recently gained theHighest honors in the college at Paris, and dined onThe same day with the king of France, the descendantOf St. Louis, at the palace of the Toiletries. AndLet me add, if I may refer to my own experience, thatIn Paris, I have sat for weeks, at the School of Law,On the same benches with colored persons, listening,Like myself, to the learned lectures of DegradeAnd of Russia— the last is the eminent minister whoHas unhappily fallen beneath the dagger of a RomanAssassin; nor do I remember observing in the throngOf sensitive young men by whom they were surrounded,Any telling towards them except of companionshipAnd respect. In Italy, at the Convent of Pallazuola,On the shores of the Alban Lake, and on the site ofThe ancient Alba Longer, I have seen, for several days,A native of Abyssinia, only recently conducted from]His torrid home, and ignorant of the language thatWas spoken about him, yet mingling with the FranciscanFriars, whose guest and scholar he was, in delightfulAnd affectionate familiarity. In these examplesMay be discerned the Christian spirit. And. Finally, it is this spirit that I invoke. Wherethis prevails, there is neither Jew nor Gentile, Greeknor barbarian, bond nor free; but all are alike. Itis from this Thai we drive now and Solemn assurancesof the equality of mankind, as an ordinance ofgod. The bodies of memo may be unequal in beautyor strength; these mortal cloaks of flesh may differ,as do these worldly garments, these intellectualfaculties may vary, as do the opportunities of actionand the advantages of position; but amidst all unessentialdifferences, there is an sectional agreementand equality. Dives and Lazarus were equal in thesight of god. They must bra equal in the sight ofall just institutions. But this is not all. The vaunted superiority of thewhite race imposes upon it corresponding duties.The faculties with which these are endowed, and theAdvantages which they possess, are to be exercisedFor the good of all. If the cores people are ignorant,Degraded and unhappy, then should they be theEspecial objects of your care. Form the abundanceOf your possessions, you must seek to remedy theirLot. And this court, which is as a parent to all theUnfortunate children of the common wealth, willShow it self most truly parental when it reaches down,And, with the strong arm of the law, elevates,Encourages and protects its colored fellow- citizens.
