 'Let California alone. She is rising up with amagic suddenness upon the smooth shores of thepacific, astonishing the world with the richness of hergolden treasures, and the rapidity of her commercialstrides to greatness. Her mines invite our peculiarlabor. There are some slaves already within herlimits, and several hundred thousand of them wouldnot exhaust them for slaves if now doubtless command therefrom two to three thousand dollars. A salve ownercould make, at the mines, several thousand dollars tothe hand, per year. This is not a favored falsehood,Nor the theory of an enthusiast, if reports are to berelied on. Slavery is an expansive Institution. Giveit room, and it flourishes; but confine it withinnarrow limits, and it not only becomes valueless, butessentially dangerous.' â€” flagella, geo.
