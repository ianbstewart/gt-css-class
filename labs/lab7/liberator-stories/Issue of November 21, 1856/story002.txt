 From the Charleston Mercury.   To His Excellency James H. Adams, Governor of theState of South Carolina: To His Excellency James H. Adams, Governor of theState of South Carolina: When the Secession controversy dosed in SouthCarolina, your Excellency might very well haveopposed that, for your day at least, all furthercontest for the independence of the South was aton end. The North, by precluding the Southerntakes from colonizing any of the Territories acquiredfrom Mexico, had to await the naturalcourse of events, and their mastery in the Unionwas certain. The natural progress of their population,swollen by European emigration, must convert these cast Territories into free States,and in twenty or thirty years give the North, inCongress, two-thirds of the Senate and House ofrepresentatives. With such a preponderance, thefresh might-more in the councils of the Unionwith a power almost irresistible. To await sucha result was clearly the policy of those who aimedat the overthrow of the institution of slavery inthe South, by the agency of the General Government.But unjust power is seldom wise. Successfullyexercised, there seems to be a sort of fatalitywhich will not let it rest. The Abolitionistswould not wait for the natural course of events,which would have certainly given them Kansas.they determined to anticipate time, and by excitingcontest prematurely, will lose Kansas, and Itrust will, ere long, lose also the Union, and produceour deliverance.  The Tariff and slavery are kindred subjects inthe Northern mind, and have been so associatedin the politics of the Union as to be identical.They are the two grand instrumentalities by whichalone the consolidation of the Government can beaffected. If the Government is to be a limitedGovernment at all, it must be limited on the taxingpower and the institution of slavery. If itto omnipotent on the one, without constitutionalauthority, it must extend its power over theother. Hence, every stride the Government tookto omnipotence in taxation, brought it nearer tothe point of omnipotence over slavery. The powerswhich a Protective Tariff is enacted by Conor bywould give the right of emancipation.—Emancipation is taking our property, and givingit to our slaves—a Protective Tariff takes it, andgives it to Manufacturers. The only differenceconsists in the persons to whom our property isgiven—but the power, the principle, is the same.in the effort to consolidate the General Government,the actors, in consolidation, from the identity ofof principle involved, were thus naturally ledfrom one of these subjects to the other to enforcetheir policy. But interest and fanaticism impelled to thesame course. No people can be safelyentrusted with the power of taxing another people,when they can be benefitted by the taxes imposed;and a slaveholding people must be romanticindeed in their confidence, who will voluntarilyperil the institution of slavery by subjectingit to the power or caprice of any other people.With our Northern people, especially, it was absurdto expect any other result than that whichhas occurred. They are a great, but essentially adomineering, fanatical, and avaricious people.The basis of their institutions is utterly antagotisticto the institution of slavery. To have thepower of taxation in their hands, and to use it toenrich and aggrandize their section of the Unionat the expense of the Sooth, was a matter ofcourse; and once let it be understood, by the consolidationof the Government, that they are responsiblefor for the extension and existence of slavery,and their interference and hostility can hardlyin condemned. We should remember that theyare a very different people from ourselves. Differencein pursuits and modes of industry makes amarked difference in the characteristics of a people.A mercantile or a manufacturing people arevery different from an agricultural people. Accusomedto live and act in crowds, the latter arestore excitable and fanatical. But the great differencebetween the North and the South resultsfrom the institution of slavery. It is this whichhas made a North and a South. It is this whichhas made two sections in the Union, and has raisedup a bitter rivalry between them. Sectionalambition has thus been added to interest and fanaticism,in bringing the North upon the South.It is very useless to endeavor to ignore this rivalry.Wherever republics have been united in aConfederacy, it has existed, and has been the grandcause of their dissolution. I assert, without fearcontradiction, that never before has there existed,is any Confederacy, ancient or modern, amore powerful combination of rival interests andfeelings, then these which now exist in the UnitedStates, between the two great section of theUnion. Congress is now as omnipotent over us as theBritish Parliament endeavored to be over our ancestorsin its powers of legislation. Had we followedtheir example, and resisted the usurpationsof Congress, war would not have followed, as inour Revolution, but there would have been a peacefulconservation enforced, such as took place inEngland in 1688. The Constitution, with its limitations,would have been preserved in full efficiency,and the meditated resolution, by consolidation,would have been rolled back. But, by a longcourse of submission, the South new labors underone of the most odious and dangerous despotismsthat ever ruled a people. We are governed by amajority in Congress, irresponsible to us, vulgarand fanatical, hating us and hating our institution. If, in 1820, the South had stood form in themaintenance of her right of equality in our Territories,the Union would not have been dissolved,nor would we now be contending in Kansas for thevery rights we then abandoned. If, in 1833, SouthCarolina had persisted in her resistance to the Tariffof 1828, until she obtained the principle forwhich she contended—taxation for revenue only—the constitution would have been restored on thisvital point, and the Union, resting upon it, wouldhave been stronger than ever. If South Carolina hadfulfilled her pledges to resist the Tariff of 1842, bywhich the Tariff of 1833 was faithlessly over thrown,she would have settled all controversy upon thismatter for ever, and would have quelled the risingspirit of anti-slavery in the North, by manifestingthat its efforts, through the General Government,must be vain. If any of the Southern States hadordered their Representatives to leave their seatsin Congress whenever the 21st Rule should be revealed,it never would have been repealed. Andlastly, if South Carolina had seceded from theUnion in 1852, it may not have been too late tohave saved the Union, on the firm basis of theConstitution. A re-understanding of the termsin which the South stood toward the North by theConstitution, sight have taken place, and theUnion have been preserved for generations to comeOn the occasion of each and every one of theseaggressions on the South, there was but one wayof arresting them, and of restoring the Constitution—resistance by the South generally, or by oneor more of the Southern States, in their high sovereigncapacity—thereby presenting to the Norththe simple alternative of disunion, or our rights.To induce any people to desist from any policydear to their interest or fanaticism, you must placebefore them an alternative, which presents to themthe impossibility of their policy being carried out,or that greater evils are to result from its continuancethan its abandonment. Both of these motiveswould hats been presented to the people ofthe North, had any of the Southern States promptlyand resolutely resisted their aggressions. Persistenceon their part would have dissolved theUnion; and by the dissolution of the Union, theirpolicy must have ended. The subjects of their avariciousand fanatical experiments would haveescaped from their hands, whilst the Governmentby which they intended to build up their sectionalaway and aggrandizement over the South, wouldcease to exist. On the other hand, by yielding tooar demands, they would have lost nothing but thePower to wrong and oppress; whilst we wouldhave gained nothing bat rights which we possessedpreviously by the Constitution. They would stillretain those advantages which, under the mostimpartial administration of the Constitution, mustpour into their section of the Union a continualstream of wealth and prosperity. By this policyof resistance, too, we would have abandoned theweak position of the defensive, and, at the sametime, have enabled our friends at the North (rather,I would say, the friends of the Constitution)to have sustained themselves. The question would,not have been, protection or no protection by theTariff to manufactures, by which they were put ina false position of opposing a policy beneficial totheir section of the union; or of slavery or anti-slavery,by which they ware liable to he representedas the supporters of slavery, or the tools ofslaveholders: bat the question would hare been.Union or Disunion. And, on this issue, theywould have crushed their enemies and ours by theoverwhelming consideration of interests which theUnion fosters in the North, and the tremendousdisasters and ruin its dissolution must produce.But we have chosen the weak and ungenerous partof submission, by which we have heretofore destroyedour friends and exalted our enemies. It may he said, that the policy of resistancecould not have saved the Union, for the aggressingStates would have used the General Government tocoerce a resisting State, and thus the Union wouldhave been dissolved. An attempt to coerce a Stateby the General Government, no doubt would havedissolved the Union; hut the reasons which I havestated, I think quite sufficient to refute the probabilityof so desperate a course being resorted to.But admit that, in the licentiousness of folly, sucha course had been pursued, it would only provethat under no circumstances could the Union bepreserved. If resistance to keep it within its prescribedorbit could not save it, it is now plain thatsubmission cannot save it, consistent with therights and safety of the South. Men are always prone to look at proximatecauses, which are seldom the controlling causesof events. The great evil under which the Southlabors is not that she is wrongfully taxed by theGovernment; it is not slavery agitations resultingfrom the Fugitive Slave Act, or a denial of ourequal rights in our Territories. These are evils,but they are results. The great cause which hasproduced the slavery agitation and unjust taxationis that the Government has become consolidated.It is this cause which has made the limitationsin the Constitution matter for derision.It is this cause which has made all compromisescheats. It is this cause which renders moderationor forbearance in the General Government utterlyhopeless. If submitted to, it must go on, fulfillingits destiny of despotism, until it rolls theblack tempest of emancipation upon the South.What the South wants is—the first great requisiteof every people, and a stern necessity of a slaveholdingpeople—a free Government. We must,practically, rule ourselves. Representation is thegrand instrumentality by which it has been supposeda people must rule themselves. This istrue, if the Representatives ruling are truly theRepresentatives of the people governed. But if apeople join in association with another people,who have antagonist interests and institutions,and allow the Representatives of that other peopleto rule them, how do they rule themselves! Theyare governed as absolutely under the will of othersas if they had a single despot over them.Such is practically now the case under the GeneralGovernment Northern Representatives, representingthe interests and feelings of the Northernpeople, have the power to control the Government.The Constitution no longer exists as a restrainingelement of power, but a majority in Congressa ways our destinies. The late Presidential election might be appealedto as proving that we have a power in the Unionwhich might yet reform it, and make us free underits Government. It does show the folly of our pastsubmission. It does prove that the manifestationof a resolute spirit of resistance is, and ever hasbeen, the only means of checking the presumptuousaggressions of the North. But look to whatwe submitted before we manifested this spirit:The Fugitive Slave Act, nullified to all intentsand purposes throughout the North in its practicaloperations, and citizens of the South beaten andmurdered for attempting to enforce it; a majorityof Abolitionists electing the Speaker of the Houseof Representatives in Congress—controlling all itsCommittees—and bold enough to defeat the ArmyAppropriation Bill, unless their policy shall beincorporated with it; emigrants armed and paidto appropriate Kansas, and an army raised todrive us out of it by force; slavery made the grandelement of all politics at the North, on whichturns all their electrons, and the election of thePresident of the United States. When we madethe infamous surrender of our rights, by submittingto the Compromise of 1850, who presumed toanticipate that these things could be within sixyears afterwards! Who foretold to the peoplethat, within this brief period of time, the SouthernStates would endure the humiliation of allowingtheir Representatives to sit in a legislativebody controlled by Abolitionists—their citizens tobe murdered or driven out of the Territory—andtheir institution to be the common topic of ribalddeclamation and abuse is all elections throughoutthe North! How rapid and how vast has beenour descent from the high position of honor, dignityand strength once occupied by the South!And can we look upon a retrogression from suchgorse and insulting deeds by the North us givingas any assurance that they are proposed to surrender,at our bidding their long-desired power overus! Admit that by the Prudential election, weshall win Kansas—will that put an and to antislaveryagitation in Congress or the Union?What produced the defeat of the Abolitionists ifthe North! Simply as apprehension that theSouth would dissolve the Union if they were successful.Interest mastered fanaticism. That isall. The Constitution, or the rights it secured tous, did not weigh a feather in the result. TheNorth still holds the mastery in Congress. Wehave got no guarantee against future aggressionsand agitations. The Tariff, the grand kindred instrumentalityfor sectional domination, is open forrenewed encroachments—the Treasury for plunder,and our vast territories for their limitless expansion.They may be defeated again and againon particular measures, but until we have a reconsiderationof the Constitution, and distinct guarantiesagainst future aggressions, the South willhave gained no peace. Isolated concessions, ortemporary triumphs, are worth nothing, and areworse than nothing, if they lull us into inactivity,in reaching after the higher practical securities bywhich alone we can be safe or free. Liberty doesnot consist in present immunity from oppression.The veriest despotisms are often just in their administration.But liberty consists in having instrumentalities—guaranties against oppression.Liberty, to be liberty, must be a thing of right,not of sufferance—a grand irrefragible law, supportedby acknowledged and efficient power, whichsays to the aggressor, 'Thus far shalt thou go,and no further;' and to the innocent, 'Sit underthine own vine and thine own fig tree.' I can seenothing in the whole Presidential election, nothingin the history of the past, which affords anygood reason to believe that the North will over allowus to set an by the Constitution the efficientbarriers to their power our liberty requires. Theymay yield hereafter, as they have done before, toprevent pressure; but it will only be to disarmresistance, that they may return at some futureday to the easier completion of their policy. Theymay now yield Kansas, as they yielded the tariffof 1828, hut they expect to regain Kansas, as theyregained the protective policy, whilst they cannotbut perceive that the concession of this territoryis most insignificant, when compared with the vastterritory, sufficient for forty States, which theywrested from us but six years since. The time ispassed when high constitutional guaranties can beobtained by the South. The people of the Northare strong in their consciousness of power. Thegrand object of their sectional ambition and rivalry—unchecked predominance in the Union—theythink will soon be realized. Once they respected,perhaps feared us; but by our repeated acts ofsubmission to their aggressions, we have lost boththeir respect and fear. They actually now believethat we are afraid of them and of ourselves. Theywill risk Disunion rather than make constitutionalconcessions which will divest them of theirpower over us; and not until they have practicallylearned what Disunion is will they either respectus or show us justice. If, then, a practical despotism is the great evilunder which the South labors, and the North is notprepared to give us constitutional guaranties forour protection and liberties, what course shouldthe South pursue! The next Congress will witnessrenewed efforts for the plunder of the Southby their grand alternative—the Tariff. They willstrive to exempt ell imported commodities, necessaryor useful to their industrial pursuits, from alltaxation, and thus makes the Tariff more unequaland unjust in its operation on the South than ever.Even a simple, ad valorem Tariff, such as SouthCarolina, by her resistance in 1833, wrung, atleast by statute, from the reluctant North, willhardly be a possibility. The expenditures will goon with increased investment and profligacy, inorder that the high taxes of the Tariff might besustained. The taxes will again be laid, and willagain be appropriated, to the enrichment and aggrandizementof the North. The Presidentialveto, since the late transactions in Congress, mayhe considered as abolished—that last check on theomnipotence of a majority in Congress, which hashitherto so often saved the Constitution from thegrasp of power. If such should be the true stateof our affairs, what course should the South pursue! ad valorem In sty humble judgment. all true statesmanship inthe South consists in forming combinations, and shapingevents so as to bring about, as speedily as possible,a dissolution of the present Union, and a Southern Confederacy. all true statesmanship inthe South consists in forming combinations, and shapingevents so as to bring about, as speedily as possible,a dissolution of the present Union, and a Southern Confederacy. Let the South—formerly I would have said, letSouth Carolina—demand, in the approaching modificationsof the tariff, that it shall be reduced atleast to the standard and principles of the year1833. That tariff was the fruit of her energy andcourage, and was a contract with her for the remissionof her resistance. It was forced from thegeneral government by her action, single and alone,when there stood at its head, as its Chief Magistrate,the most powerful and popular man in theUnion since the days of Washington. If such a tariff is not conceded to as, why shouldSouth Carolina, or any other Southern State, anylonger keep representatives in Congress! Even ifwe are not prepared to secede from the Union,why sanction, by our representation, the acts ofour oppressors, and swell the pomp, and ministerto the power of the general government! Thewithdrawal of the representatives of the State fromCongress will enable them to be of more use, intwo years, than by fifty years of service at Washingtonunder the present condition of the Union. The States, in their sovereign capacity, adoptedthe Constitution, and by their action alone canany new guarantees be inserted into it. One ormore of the Southern States can test our true conditionby proposing to amend the Constitution bysuch new securities as our safety and liberties require.If the Northern States accept of them,than the Union will be worth preserving. If theyreject then, let the Union be destroyed. If theyreject then, let the Union be destroyed. And why should we not dissolve our political connectionwith the people of the North? Have we notin vain done our duty to them, in all patience andhumility? Are there any remembrances of the pastwhich they have not embittered, or feelings of affectionwhich they have not outraged? Have theynot, for a long course of years, put upon us indignitiesand wrongs which they never would haveborne from us or from any other people! Theirconduct towards us, if we were independent nations,would long since have justified us in declaringagainst them. They have violated the,great compact of the Constitution, and every compromisewe have made with them to win their forbearance.Instead of that friendship which acommon confederacy implies, they have, for twentyyears, pursued towards us a  of the ruthless hostility. long since   Men are now uphold as their exponents andleaders, Governors of States and members of Congress,who openly declare their purpose to destroyus, and exult in the precept of the slaughter anddesolation they  carrying over the South.Their association with us in a common confidhas given them a moral power, which they haveused only to disparate and degrade as in the eyesof foreign nations. We are represented as gardfulof war  relations, and  in I speak knowledge—nowhere in the marriage the morefaithfully observed than among the slaveholdersof the South. We are represented as an uncivilized,semi-barbarous people. If human misery,an exposed in crime and pauperism, is any test ofcivilization, our civilization is superior, to that ofthe North, or perhaps to that of any other peoplein the world; whilst in refinement of manners,we are surely not very interior. We are representedas an unchristian and unchristianzing people.The records of religion will prove that, inproportion to the population, there are more membersof the Church of Christ at the South than atthe North; whilst we have brought into its holypale more of -the heathen in our midst, than allother nations, with all their missionary efforts together,including England, with her hundred millionsof heathen Asiatic subjects. We can neverbe known, appreciated or respected, until we arean independent people. Why, then, should wecontinue in confederation with the NorthernStates! Are we dependent on them, in any way,or for any thing? Our commerce is self-sustaining.It consists chiefly of agricultural staples,which the whole world needs. They are dependenton us, not we on them, in the affairs of commerce,and make millions annually out of us byits operations. Do we need their association withus for internal protection! We are fully competentto protect ourselves; and if we were not, andturned to them for assistance, we know that theywould rather fire the torch of insurrection than extinguishit. Are we not sufficiently powerful toprotect ourselves from foreign nations! We arethe most important people in the world to its welfareand happiness.        If, by a sudden stroke from the Almighty, theSouthern States were annihilated, it would occasiona greater shock to the civilization and comfortof other nations, than the extinction of anyother people inhabiting its surface What, then,have we to fear from foreign states! By our productionswe can command their friendship andpeace; whilst, by our physical power, we can defytheir hostility. Eight millions of the white race,raised to the use of arms, and constituting oneof the most military people in the world, inhabitinga country intersected all over by railroads, areunconquerable by any power upon earth. Why,then, should we not be independent in government.as we are in all our resources for national power,wealth and prosperity! Why should we still continuevexed tributaries to the North—harassed dependencies—despised underlings, to be eternallyscourged from tariff to slavery, and from slaveryto tariff—only, at last, to be trampled out of existencein blood! I know full well, sir, that there are many in theSouth, even now, after an experience of fortyyears, who are prepared to do nothing, or to embracenew compromises. The vis inertias of aslaveholding agricultural people is immense. Scatteredend isolated, and accustomed, each man, toact and to rule for himself, combination for anypurpose is most difficult of attainment. Andthen, there stand the two great natural allies ofsubmission under all governments—gain and timidity.Money-makers of all kinds hate allchanges, or fear all changes, which my disturbtheir gains and timidity shrinks from any contest.But, will the man of gain tell me what hisproperty will be worth to him or his children, ifhe continues in the Union under the control of abolitionism!Does be realize—first, the gradualdepreciation of all property in the South from asense of insecurity—then emigration—then a declinein power, whilst the North towers in omnipotence?—then, when enfeebled and dispirited, avain struggle, and the South is abolitionism?Where, then, will he the gains for which he disgracedhis manhood and betrayed his country byan abject submission? Will the man of fears tellme which is the most dangerous, a government ofthe Southern States, united together by a commonbond of institutions and pursuits; or a governmentof the present Union, under the control ofthe North, with all its sympathies, institutionsand prejudices against us? Has he read the historyof Mayti? Has be travelled over Jamaica? Ifno high spirit of liberty can actuate him, will nothis very fears rise an and bid him be bold andfree? Break from the North, and give us a Southernconfederacy, as you vales honor, prosperity,life itself. Those who have been watching andwaiting and striving for Southern independenceand a Southern Union—although at times theirhearts may have died away within, them in despair—have heard the late tumult at the North,mustering its power against the South, with rekindledhope and loftier resolutions. Oh! let thecontest come? If true to ourselves, a ourselves, gloriousdestiny awaits us, and the South will yet be agreat, free and independent people! vis inertias In the views I have thus laid before you, yourexcellency will recognize that policy whichhave advocated for twenty-eight years, and haveendeavored to have enforced by South Carolina.Three times I have counselled her to resist theusurpations of the general government to a practicalenforcement and acknowledgment of herrights, and three times I have fallen beneath hercondemnation. May I be pardoned if, from thedepths of my retirement, with the blazing lights ofexperience before me, I venture once more to offerthe same councils, and to plead for that policywhich has commanded the best energies of my politicallife, and which it is my most ardent aspirationthe I might be permitted to see consummatedbefore I die. Time admonishes us both, that what we are ableto do, we should do quickly; whilst our childrenaround ns cannot but remind as of the high responsibilitieswhich rest upon us, to transmit tothem, untarnished and unimpaired, that heritageof freedom which we received from ourfathers. You will do your part. Whether aschief magistrate of the State, or in the walksof private life, you will ever, I know, hold thehonor of South Carolina to be higher and dearerthan life. Relying in your personal friendshipfor an indulgent of any arrears youmay perceive in the views I have presented. I remainyour Excellency's most humble and obedientservant. R. BARNWELL RHETT.
