 Extract from the new and valuable pamphlet, byTHEODORE PARKER, just published in Boston, entitled'The Great Battle between Slavery and Freedom:— HEODORE ARKER I fear you do yet quite understand differencebetween the Regressive Force of Slavery atthe South, and the Progressive Force of Freedomat the North. Therefore, to see in noonday lightthe effect of each an the present Welfare and thefuture Progress of a people, compare as old typicalSlave State with as old typical Free State, andthan compare a new Slave State with a new FreeState. 1. South Carolina contains 29,285 squares smilesof land; Connecticut, 4,674. Is 1856, SouthCaroline and 668,507 inhabitants, whereof 283,123were free, and 384, 984 slaves; white Connecticuthad 370,792 inhabitants, all free. The governments value of all the land in SouthCarolina was $5.06 as sore; in Connecticut it was$30,50 the sore. All the farms in South Carolinacontained 16,217,700 series, and were worth$82,431.684, though they contained onlyworth $72,726,422, though they consulted only2,383,879 acres. Thus slavery and freedom affectthe value of land in the old States. value of land In 1850, South Carolina had 340 miles of railroad;and Connecticut 547, on a territory notequal to one-sixth of South Carolina. In 1855,South Carolina had $11,500,000 in railroads;Connecticut had then $20,000,000. The shipping of South Carolina amounts to36,000 tons; in Connecticut, to 125,000, thoughshe is not advantageously situated for navigation. The value of the real and personal property inSouth Carolina, in 1850, was estimated by the FederalGovernment at $288,257,694. This includesthe value of all the slaves, who, at $400 apiece,amount to $153,993,600. Substracting this sum,which is neither property in land nor things,but wholly unreal and fictitious, there remains$134,264,094 as the entire property of the greatSlave State while the total valuation of theland and things in Connecticut, in 1850. was$155,707,980. In other words, in South Carolina,670,000 persons, with 36,000 square miles of land,are worth $134,000,000; while in Connecticut,370,000 men, with only 4,600 square miles of land,are worth $156,000,000. Thus do slavery andfreedom affect the general worth of the people inthe old States. general worth In 1850. South Carolina bad 365,026 personsunder twenty years of age: her whole number ofpupils, at schools, academies, and colleges, was40,373. Connecticut had only 157,146 persona ofthat age, bat 83,697 at school and college. Willyou say it is of no consequence whether the coloredchild is educated or not? Then remember thatSouth Carolina had 149,322 white children, andonly sent 40,373 of them to school at all in thatyear; while, out of 153,862 white children, Connecticutgave 82,433 a permanent place in her nobleschools. coloredchild In South Carolina, there are but 129,350 freepersons over twenty years of age; and, of these,16,564 are unable to read the word Heaven. So,in all that great and Democratic State, there areonly 112,786 persons over twenty, who know theirA B C's; while in Connecticut there are 213,062persons over twenty; and, of all that number, only5,306 are illiterate, and of them 4,013 are foreigners.But, of all the 16,564 ignoramuses of SouthCarolina, only 104 were born out of that State' ignoramuses Out of 365,026 persons over twenty, S. Carolinahas only 112,786 who can read their primer; while,out of 213,662, Connecticut has 208,356 who canread and write. South Carolina can boast morethan 250,000 native adults who cannot write orread the name of their God,—a noble army ofmartyrs, a cloud of witnesses to its peculiar institution;while poor Connecticut has only 1,293 nativeadults unable to read their Holy Bible. Such is the effect of slavery and freedom on educationin the old States. The Southern politicianwas right: 'Free society is a failure!' education 2. Now compare two new States of about thename age. Arkansas was admitted into the Unionin 1836. Michigan in 1837. Arkansas contains 52,198 square miles, and209,807 inhabitants, of whom 151,746 are free,and 58,161 are slaves. Michigan contains 56,243square miles, and was entered for settlement laterthan her sister, but contains 397,654 persons, allfree. In Arkansas, the land in valued at $5.83 theacre; and, in Michigan, at $11 83. The SlaveState has 781,531 acres of improved land; andMichigan, 1,929,110. The farms of Arkansasare worth $15,265,245; and these of Michigan,$51,872,446. Thus slavery and freedom affect thevalue of land in the new States. value of land Michigan had (in 1855) 699 miles of railroad,which had cost $19,000.000; Arkansas had paidnothing for railroads. The total valuation of Arkansas,in 1850. was $39,871,020: the value ofthe slaves, $23,264,400, was included. Deductingthat, there remains but $16,576,625, as the entireworth of Arkansas: while Michigan has propertyto the amount of $59,787,255. Thus slavery andfreedom affect the of property in the newStates. of property In 1850, Arkansas had 115,023 children undertwenty, whereof 11,050 were in schools, academies,or colleges; while Michigan had 211,969, of whom112,382 were at school, academy, or college. Or, toomit the colored population, Arkansas had 97,402white persons under twenty, and only 11,050 attendingschool; while, of 210,831 whites of thatage in Michigan. 112,175 were at school or college.Last year, Michigan had 132,234 scholars in herpublic schools. In 1850, Arkansas contained64,787 whites over twenty,—but 16,935 ofthese were unable to read and write: while, out of184,240 of that age in Michigan, only 8,281 werethus ignorant.—of these, 3,009 were foreigners;while, of the 16,935 illiterate persons of Arkansas,only 37 were born out of that State. The SlaveState had only 47,852 persons over twenty whocould read a word; while the Free State had175,959. Michigan had 107,948 volumes in 'librariesother then private,' and Arkansas 420 volumes.Thus slavery and freedom affect the education of thepeople in the new States. the education of thepeople Now, see the effect of slavery and freedom onProperty and Education in their respective Neighborhoods.I take examples from the States ofMissouri and Virginia, kindly furnished by an ingeniousand noble-hearted man. 1. In the twelve counties of Missouri which borderon slaveholding Arkansas, there are 20,982free white persons, occupying 75,300 acres of improvedland, valued at $13 an acre, or $989,932;while in the ten counties of Missouri bordering onIowa, a Free State, though less attractive in soiland situation, there are 26,890 free white persons,with 123,030 acres of improved land, worth $19an acre, or $2,379,765. Thus the neighbor heed ofslavery retards the development of property. neighbor heed ofslavery retards the development of property. In those ten Northern counties bordering onfreedom, there were 2,329 scholars in the publicschools; while in the twelve Southern, borderingon Arkansas, there were only 339. Thus the neighborhoodof slavery effect the development of education. the neighborhoodof slavery effect the development of education. 2. Compare the Northern with the Southerncounties of Virginia, and you find the same results.Monongahela and Preston counties, in Virginia,bordering on free Pennsylvania, contain 122,444acres of improved land, rained at $21 an acre, or$2,784,137 in all; are occupied, by 24,095 persons,whereof 263 only are slaves; and there are 1,747children in the public schools; while the correspondingcounties of Patrick and Henry, touchingon North Carolina, contain but 99,731 acres of improvedland, worth only $15 on sere, or $1,554,341in all; are occupied by 18,481 inhabitants, 5,664of them slaves; and have only 961 children atschool. But erase the borders, and vote thechange: the adjacent counties of North Carolina,Rockingham and States, contain 163,784 acres ofimproved land, worth $14 an acre, or $1,517,520;23,701 persons, of whom 7,122 are slaves; andhave only 2,050 public at school or college; whileFayette and Green counties, is Pennsylvania, adjacentto the port of Virginia above spoken of, contain297,005 acres of improved land, valued at $49an acre, or $7,618,917; 61,218 persons, all free;and 12,998 public at the common student. The South has numerous natural advantagesover the North,—a latter soil, a more generalclimate, the privilege of producing those tropicalplants now deemed indispensable to civilization.Of $193,000,000 of exports last year, $93,000,000were of Southern cotton and tobacco. Yet such isher foolish and wicked system, that, while theNorth continually increases in riches, the Southbecomes continually poorer and poorer in comparison.Boston alone could buy up two States likeSouth Carolina, and still have thirteen millions ofdollars to spare. Three hundred years ago, Spainmonopolized this continent; she exploitered Mexico,Peru, the islands of the Gulf; all the gold ofthe New World came to her hand. Where is itnow? Spain is pooer than Italy. Is here no lesson for South Carolina and Virginia?
