 THE U.S. CONSTITUTION IS 'A COVENANT WITH DEATHAND AN AGREEMENT WITH WILL' ☞'Yes! IT CANNOT BE DENIED—the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of theirsent of the Constitution, there special provisions toTHE PERPETUITY OF THEIR DOMINION OVER THEIR SLAVES. The first was the humanity, for twenty years,of preserving the African slave trade; the second wasTHE STIPULATIONS TO SURRENDER FUGITIVE SLAVES—onagreement positively prohibited by the have of God,delivered from Sinai; and, thirdly, the exaction, fetalto the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor SLAVES—for articles of merchandise, underthe name of persons. . . . In fact, the oppressor representingthe oppressed! . . . To call government thus constituteda democracy, is to insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slavery. Its reciprocal operatives upon thegovernments of the nation is to establish an artificialmajority in the slave representation over that of thefree people, in the American Congress; AND THEREBYTO MAKE THE PRESERVATION, PROPAGATION AND PRESERVATIONOF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANIMATING SPIRITOF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.—John Quincy Adams.
