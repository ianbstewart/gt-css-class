 It seems that the Legislature of the State of Massachusettsdecided, on Friday last, by a vote oftwo hundred and sixty-eight to one, that the fanaticswho petitioned that body for a dissolution of theUnion might have leave to withdraw their petitions.Mr. Tolman, of Worcester, was the member whovoted in the negative. If we are not very much, Mr. Tolman, in common with the othermembers of the Legislature of Massachusetts,while taking the customary oath the membersof that body must take, swore solemnly that hewould support the Constitution of the Unites States.If he did so, we would like to know how he reconcileshis vote on those positions with that oath.  This however, in a matter purely personal. Weare glad to see that there is some evidence of returningreason in Massachusetts; and the unanimitywith which this vote was carried will be some recompenseto the Southern States for the injury whichthe Boston fanatics have inflicted on them. It willshow that the people of New England are not quiteno demanded as one might suppose on the slaveryquestion.â€”New York Harold. New York Harold.
