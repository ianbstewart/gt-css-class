 NEW YORK, 11th Feb., 1850. EW ORK MR. DEAR SIR:—As one of your immediate constituents,permit me to express to you my views onthe resolutions lately submitted to the Senate byMr. Clay. They are skillfully drawn, and their trueimport seems to me to be generally misunderstood,and, in many instances intentionally misrepresented.Various considerations combine to render these resolutionsacceptable to that class of our Northernpoliticians who are anxious to be popular at home,without forfeiting their share of the patronage whichis disposed at Washington by the Slave Fewer.The resolutions are sight in number, and I will examinethem in their order. R. EAR IR 1. This proposes the admission of California as aState, without the imposition by Congress of any restrictionon the subject of slavery, and 'with evitableboundaries.' These words imply that presentboundaries are unsuitable, and must be altered.Let me now call your attention to the true reason forthis reservation about boundaries, and respectingwhich the resolution is silent. During the war, andbefore the cession of any territory, the House Representativespassed the Wilmot Proviso, prohibitingslavery in all the territory that might be acquired.On this, the Sooth, with one voice, declared thatthey would not submit to the exclusion of slaverysouth of 36 80. The Legislature of Alabama resolvedthat they would not recognize 'any enactmentof the federal government which has for itsobject the prohibition of slavery in any territoryone acquired by conquest or treaty SOUTH of theline of the Missouri Compromise.' At a publicmeeting in Charleston, and at which I believe Mr.Call soon was present, it was received that it wouldbe debasing and dishonorable to submit to the prohibitionof slavery 'beyond what is already yieldedby the Missouri Compromise,' and innumerable havebeen the offers and efforts of Southern politicians toextend the compromise line to the Pacific. Henceit is not the exclusion of slavery in California tothe north of that has that offends the South, and toadmit this anti-slavery State, bounded on the southby 36 30, is doing no more than what the South hasconsented should be done, and is in no sense a compromise.But the free State of California extendssouth of that line, and hence her southern boundaryis unsuitable, and hence Mr. Clay's resolution makesa tacit provision for depriving the State of so muchof her territory as his Southern friends have resolvedshall not be consecrated to freedom. Mr. Foote,of Mississippi, observed in relation to this very resolution,'I see no objection to admitting all Californiaabove the line of 36 30 into the Union, providedanother now slave State be laid off within the  anothernew slave State, Mr. Clay's compromise opposesno obstacle! Had Mr. Clay proposed the admissionof California with 'its present boundaries,' his offerwould so far have been a compromise, as to concedesomething to freedom as a consideration for the surrenderof the Wilmot Proviso. 'with evitableboundaries.' true reason all south south unsuitable no objection above   2. The next resolution declares that  at slaveryclass not amid exist by lane, and is not  is be introduced.'into any of the conquered territories, they should beorganized under territorial governments without anyrestriction on the subject of slavery. The proposedambition by Congress, that slavery does not exist bylaw in the territories, is hailed as an all sufficientbalm to the consciences of these who recoil withhorror at the idea of being in any degree responsiblefor the extension of human bondage. Andwhat, let me ask, is this declaration, but the enunciationof a bold tru? We all know there is nolaw, Mexican or American, recognizing slavery inthe territories. Mr. Clay adroitly avoids drawingany inference from this acknowledged fact, but expectsthat the good people of the North will drawfor themselves the inference, that because slaverydoes not exist by law, therefore it is prohibited bylaw. Property in elephants does not exist by lawin New York, but still it exists because it is notprohibited by law. Mr. Clay well known that Mr.Calhoun, and the great man of the slaveholders,contend that in the absence of a prohibitory law, men,women and children, as well as horse and sheep,may be held as property in any territory of the UnitedStates; and this doctrine Mr. Clay himself nowheredenies. Nay, further, Mr. Calhoun insists, and Ibelieve truly, that slavery never has been establishedby law in any country—that after property in manhas been acquired, then, and not before, laws arepassed to protect it. The slaveholders ask for noact of Congress authorizing them to carry their propertyinto the territories. All they ask in, that noprohibitory laws shall be passed, and thus they willcarry their slaves where they places, and keep themby their own strong hand without law, till in theirterritorial legislatures they shall pass such laws onthe subject as they shall find needful. Not a wordin Mr. Clay's compromise contravenes this legal theory,or prevents its reduction to practice. Slaverydid once exist by law in these territories; why doesit not now? Mr. Clay answers the question by tellingus that Mexican law abolished it. Now, heperfectly well known that the Mexican, law notonly abolished, but prohibited' slavery. If that lawwas repealed by the conquest, then the old law wasrevived, and slavery does  exist by law. If thelaw was not repealed by the conquest then the lawin still in force, and slavery is now prohibited by law.Why, then, does not Mr. Clay fairly and honestly declarethat slavery is now prohibited by law? Becausethis would indeed be a compromise, andwould render the provision nugatory, and would securethe territories from the curse of slavery. Thevery omission of such a declaration implies a denialof an existing prohibition, and in such denial he wellknown the whole South concurs. So far, them, is Mr.Clay's inconsequential truism from being a compromise,that it surrenders to the South even more thanshe has demanded, and thrown upon to the slaveholdersthe whole territory north as well as South of theMissouri line. But to reconcile the North to thistotal surrender, they are to be favored by Congresswith an opinion that it IS NOT LIKELY that slaverywill be introduced into any part of the conquered territory.What is only improbable in at least possible,and hence this legislature opinion would, in first, bea solemn and official declaration, that there is nolegal prohibition to the introduction of slavery. Itis not pretended that this opinion which Congressis to volunteer, is to have any legal force 'whatsoever.But what if time shall prove the opinion to havebeen erroneous, will it be any consolation to theNorth fro having by their not blighted immense regionswith human bondage, that they had been foaledby an opinion? Mr. Downe, of Louisiana, in replyto Mr. Clay, rted that there were already in theterritories some four of five hundred slaves,' andanother member declared that there would now havebeen plenty of salves them, had not their been apprehensive of the Proviso. If Mr. Clay iscorrect in his opinion, the slaveholders have beenstrangely mistaken. It was openly avowed duringthe war, that the territory to be conquered south of36 30 would be a salve region. Before our army enteredthe city of Mexico, we were offered and all Texasproper, and the whole of New Mexico and Californianorth of thirty  degrees—an extent of ten equal  of the  of New York.  at slaveryclass not amid exist by lane, and is not  is be introduced.'  bylaw  therefore by law is not in the absence of a prohibitory law never has been establishedby law after then prohibitory laws prohibited' does  exist by law.  now prohibited by law. opinion possible opinion legal opinion       The offer was rejected, and thousands were slaughteredto obtain territory south of 36 30, to be peopledwith slaves. Force the first mention of the Proviso,our Northern editors and politicians in the slave interestopposed it as unnecessary, increase,  they us, the sail and climate of these territoriesthere consistable to slave labor. The slaveholdersknew better, and never endorsed the falsehood oftheir allies. Mr. Waddy Thompson, of South Carolina,Minister to Mexico, announced to his brethren,writing of California, 'sugar, rice and cotton findthere their own congenial cli'—Recollections ofMexico, p. d. south    Recollections ofMexico  Did the South make war upon Mexico only toacquire free territory? Is she now threatening dis,and civil war for a privilege the 'is not ely'to exercise?   Upon what does Mr. Clay rest his strange unnaturalopinion? Almost exclusively on the exclusionof slavery from the California Constitution. Hedoes not pretend that this exclusion was owing tothe unfitness of the soil and climate for slave labor.We all know that the unexpected discovery of goldsuddenly collected in California a large Northernpopulation, naturally averse to slavery, and jealousor the competition of slave moor in digging gold.But does gold exist in Demerit or New Mexico? orin here a large Northern population in California,south of 36 deg. 30 min.? Is it logical to infer thatslavery is not likely to be unreduced into these territories,even with the sanction of Congress, because,under totally different circumstances. It has been excludedfrom California. New Mexico is separatedby an imaginary line from Texas, and about half ofit is claimed by that slave State. Is it likely thatTexas slaveholders will not cross the line withtheir property, or occupy territory they claim as theirown? Northernpopulation The settlers in Desert have formed Constitutionvirtually allowing slavery by not prohibiting it. Thegold diggers in California are concentrated far northof 36 deg. 30 min.; the city of San Francisco is alsonorth or that line, while south of it is a large area,where there is little to obstruct the introduction ofslavery. Under these circumstances, there are probablyvery few men in Congress who would dare, ontheir oaths, to affirm the opinion expressed by Mr.Clay. That opinion is at best a calculation ofchances; a calculation on which no man would hazarda thousand dollars; yet this miserable calculationis offered to the North as a compensation for thesurrender of all the political and moral blessingswhich the Proviso would SECURE. opinion chances Mr. Clay utterly demolishes Gen. Cass's argumentagainst the constitutionality of the Proviso, and affirmsmost positively, the right of Congress to prohibitslavery in the territories. But how stands thequestion of duty and moral consistency between thesetwo gentlemen? Undeniably in favor of the General.He has not, indeed, undertaken to solve thenice and difficult question whether human bondage isa curse or a blessing. He is sensibly alive to the atrocityof flogging two or three Hungarian women, butand tens of thousands of American women to the lash.He calls upon the nation to express its indignationat the execution of a few Hungarian insurgents takenwith arms in their hands, but given no opinion howfar it would be right or wrong to shoot certain of hisown countrymen, if taken in revolt against worsethan Austrian oppression. But he contends thatwhatever may be the moral character of slavery,Congress has no constitutional right to prohibit it,and therefore ought not to prohibit it. On the otherhand, Mr. Clay frankly declares that slavery is wrong,'a grievous wrong;' that to propagate slavery is topropagate WRONG. He affirms the constitutionalpower of Congress to prohibit this propagation ofwrong, and then calls upon Congress to permit slave-holdersto propagate this wrong when and where theyplease, over the whole wide extent of our conqueredterritory, with the single exception of what may beincluded within the State of California. Before Godand man, Gen. Cass's conclusion from his premisesis justified, while the conclusion draws by Mr. Clayfrom his premises is condemned as hostile to moralityand humanity. therefore premises 3. This resolution merely gives to Texas moreterritory than she is entitled to, and less than she demands,and is so far a compromise of territorialclaims; but in no degree a compromise between thefriends and enemies of human rights, since what isto be taken from Texas is to be immediately thrownopen to the slaveholders. 4. Texas bad, before annexation, pledged her dutieson foreign commerce as security to certain creditors.Those duties, by annexation, were surrenderedto the United States. Mr. Clay proposes thatthe United States shall assume the debts due to thesecreditors, if Texas will relinquish her claims on NewMexico. If justice requires the nation to assumethese debts, their assumption ought not to depend onthe concession of territory by Texas. If in justice wedo not own these debts, their payment by us will infact be a gratuity to Texas for the relinquishment ofone of the most impudent and fraudulent claims overmade. We have official Information, communicatedby General Jackson to Congress, that the Texans,when defining the boundaries of their new-born republics,at first determined to include California, andbeyond all question, they had them as much right toSan Francisco as they now have to Santa Fa. Theproposition of Mr. Clay is therefore to pay Texasfor territory to which she ad who has no title,and then to throw upon the territory no purchased tothe slaveholders. In this I saw  no communication tothe North. California   5. Congress is to declare it inexpedient to abolishslavery in the District of Columbia, except with theascent of Maryland and the people of the District,and making compensation to the slaveholders. Theunlimited power of Congress to abolish slavery inthe District is fully conceded, yet he calls on Congressnot to do what many of its members and vastmultitudes of their constituents believer it their moralduty to do. In this proposal, I can find no othercompromise but that of conscience. 6. The next proposal is to prohibit the importationof slaves into the District for sale. In otherwords, the inhabitants are to have a monopoly ofthe trade in human beings. These good people arenot to be deprived of the privilege of importing asmany slaves as they may want for their own use,nor of selling husbands and wives and children, to betransported to the extremities of the Union; but foreigntreasure shall no longer be permitted to glut theWashington market with their wares. The momentthe resolution passes, human chattels will rise invalue in the capital of our republic. I object notto the abolition of the trade, since it will remove oneof the many abominations with which slavery hasdisgraced the seat of our national government; butI  the proposition involves the slighted concessionon the part of the slaveholders. Says Mr.Clay himself, 'Almost every slaveholding State inthe Union has exercised its power to prohibit theintroduction of slaves in .' The powerto exercise or not, according to convenience, andon it is thought most profitable to bread or to importslaves. for sale.    7. We now  to a grand specific for giving to Northern consistent, for ying all irritation,and for restoring a general beautiful actionthroughout the present morbid  of the confed.I will give the recipe in full:—'Received,that  be made in for the resolution and delivery of  toservice or labor in any State, who may  lateany other State or territory of this Union.' That Imay not be accused of injustice to Mr. Clay in mysubsequent remands, I will quote from his speech onthis point  I do not say, sir, that a private individendis obliged to make the tour of his whole State, inorder to assist, the owner of a slave to recover hisproperty; but I do say, if he is present when the ownerof a slave is about the court his right regainpossession of his property, that he and every one present,whether officer, or agent of the State government,or private individual, is bound to assist in theexecution of the laws of their country.' 'I will gowith the farthest Senator from the South in this bodyto make penal laws to imposer the heaviest sanctionsupon the recovery of fugitive slaves, and the rerationof them to their owners.'           private individend if he is present  that he and every one present is bound penal heaviest sanctions  Such is the panacea, and such the manner inwhich our medical adviser proposes to administer it.He most not be surprised should some difficulty beexperienced in compelling the patient to swallow thedraught.' Mr. Clay has long been a favorer of those fieldsports in which the pray is MAN, and he has themerit, it is believed, of being the first to conceivethe grand idea of securing a national intercommunityin these sports, by means of international treaties.So early as the 19th June, 1826, as Secretaryof State, he proposed to the British government tothrow the Canadas open for this sport, and, in return,to British sportsmen should be accorded the privilegeof hunting West India Negroes, throughout the wholeextent, of the American Republic. But John Bullrejected the tendered reciprocity, and churlishlyreplied, 'The law of Parliament gave freedom toevery slave who effected his landing on Britishground.' About the same time, we requested from Mexicothe boon of hunting negreos over her wide area.The desired favor was denied, but we have since forciblyadded almost half her territory to our ownhunting-grounds. Of all the game laws in existence,that of 1793, which regulates the chase of negroes,is the most horrible. Should a Virginiancome to New York in search of his horse, and findhim in the possession of another, who claims him ashis property, how is he to recover the animal? Onlyby process of law, and that process requires that ajury of twelve impartial men, drawn by lot, shall passupon the conflicting claims. Neither party hasany choice in selecting the jury, nor can either establishhis claim by his own evidence. But if theVirginian is hunting a MAN, and sees one that willserve his purpose, and who will fetch a thousand dollarsin the southern market, but who claims to belongto himself, how is he to secure him? Why he maycatch his MAN as well as he can, and without warrantmay carry him before any justice of the peace whomfor sufficient reasons he may think proper to select,and swear that the MAN he has caught is his, and thejustice may surrender the MAN to perpetual bondage,degradation and misery. Various officers besidesjustices are authorized to act, so that the Virginianby law, but is not found so easy to practice. terly,various States have prohibited their earn officersfrom assisting to the chase of human beings,and citizens rarely lend any unpaid assistance.Hanes a new gazes law is deemed needful, and Mr.Clay, as we have seen, is pledged to go with 'the farthestSouthern Senator,' the most devoted lover of thesport, to make it effectual. The judiciary committeehave accordingly reported a bill, now before the Senate.'I argue,' said Mr. Mason, one of the farthestSouthern Senators, in his speech on this bill (28thJan.) 'I agree that the federal government has nopower to impose duties on the officers of State governments,as such.' Of course, the obligation imposedby the law of 1792, upon justices of the peace andother State officers, to catch slaves, are void, andour Northern Legislatures, it is admitted, have aright to prohibit them from participating in slavehunts. To obviate this difficulty, it becomes necessaryto select other than State officers to adjudicateupon questions of higher import than any, with thesingle exception of life and death, that ever exercisethe talents, learning, virtue and independence of themost august tribunals of any civilized country. Andwho are the grave and reverend judges appointed bythis bill to sit in judgment on the liberty of bondageof native-born American? Among these judgesare twenty thousand postmasters! Each one of thesenew judges is authorized to adjudge any man, womanor child, black or white, to be a vendible chattel;and this judgment is to be founded on any proofthat may be satisfactory to said postmaster in thewords of the bill, 'either by oral testimony or affidavit,'nor is the testimony either oral or by affidavit ofthe interested claimant excluded; and from thisjudgment there is no appeal! Slavery is no longerconfined to one color. The Southern papers aboundwith advertisements offering rewards for fugitiveslaves, containing the caution, that the fugitive willprobably attempt to pass for a while person. A fewyears since, a Maryland, slaveholder caught in Philadelphiaa white girl, (Mary Gilmore,) whom he claimedas his slave. The case was brought before a Pennsylvaniajudge, and occupied two days; and it wasproved by most abundant overwhelming evidence,that the alleged slave was the daughter of POORIRISH PARENTS. The mother had died in the Philadelphiahospital, and the daughter had never beenin Maryland. By a pending amendment to this bill,every man and woman who, prompted by the holiestimpulses of our nature, shall 'harbor or conceal' theprey from the hunter, is to be visited with fine andimprisonment. A few days after Mr. Clay introducedhis resolutions, Bruin &Hill, slave traders inAlexandria, wrote a letter, since published in thenewspapers, stating for the information of a freeMOTHER in New York who wished to redeem herDAUGHTER from bondage, that they cannot afford tosail 'the girl Emily for less than EIGHTEEN HUNDREDDOLLARS.' Why this prodigious price? Theyadd, 'We have two or three offers for Emily fromgentleman from the South. She is said to be thefinest looking woman in this country.' animal?  earn officers unpaid State twenty thousand postmasters! one while slave. RISH PARENTS. gentleman Should this devoted victim escape from her keepers,be afterwards found concealed in her mother's house,not only is she to be carried back and subjected tothe fate intended for her, but the MOTHER is liable bythe then present bill to be ced to pay a fine offive hundred dollars to the United States, to payMessrs. Bruin and Hill one thousand dollars for damages,and be imprisoned six months. We hope, forMr. Clay's reputation, no 'farthest senator from theSouth' will ask for heavier penalties, for if be doesMr. Clay is pledged to ante for 'the heaviest sanctions'that may be prepared. But suppose this poor girlshould find her way to Peekskill, instead of New York,and in your absence, with bursting heart, ask to beltered in your house from her pursuers. Can youfor a single moment submit the possibility, that yourwife, the mother of your children, could through fearof the law, so  herself, as to turn the tremblingfugitive into the street, or betray her to the hasten?A thousand times rather would you are the partnerof your bosom enduring Mr. Clay's heaviest sanction,'then bringing ignominy upon herself, and coveringher husband and children with chases and confusionof face, by committing a crises on foul anddetonable. Mr. Mason, in his speech, insists uponthe right of the hunter to enter peaceably any enclosureor DWELLINE where much slave may be found,for the purpose of takeing him.' Should this assertednight be incorporated into the compromise bill, thesemay southern  and northern dough-faces arelong be resuming through our  and remakingour  in search of py. Should as attemptbe made to  the  from Mr. Clay  to who be may be the prisons in New York and New England are toofew to held the vast multitude of man and woman whowould willingly  them, rather than part theirsouls by betraying the fugitive or assisting in thecapture. Mr. Clay very kindly declines requiring'a private individual to make the tour of his whole in search of a slave, but he insists that all who arepresent when the game is started, ought to follow thebounds. Could he but enforce this obligation, weshould have come grand turn-outs in New York andNew England, some like the own ferried by the post    his speech           make the tour of his whole   all present Good luck to our hunters how nobly they rideIn the glow of their real, and the strength of pickle?

So speed to their hunting over mountain and .Through cane-break and forest—the hunters of man!           But the Constitution! This instrument in substance that the fugitive slave shall be deliveredup; but Mr. Clay, I believe, is the first lawyer whohas contended that the obligation of delivery upon 'private individuals.' Even Mr. Mason, inhis speech, insists that the mandate to deliver up is'addressed to the jurisdiction of the State into whichthe fugitive may escape.' Of course, individual citizens,as such, are under no constitutional obligationto volunteer to catch slaves. But suppose a positivelaw should enjoin each individual to betray or aid incapturing the fugitive? The question put by theApostles, when legally forbidden to teach in the nameof Jesus, would then recur: 'Whether it be right inthe sight of God to hearken unto you, more thanunto God, judge ye.' It is not merely the right, butthe duty of a Christian to refuse an active obedienceto any and every law of man, which he believes contravenesthe commands of his Maker; and then, likethe apostles, to offer no forcible resistance to thepenalties attached to his disobedience.   jurisdiction of the State active Mr. Clay may rest assured, that the bill of and penalties promised in his 7th resolution, will nohave the composing influence he anticipates. Fillingour prisons with pious, benevolent, kind-heartedmen and women, will have little effect in suppressingagitation. I his compromising anodyne, Mr. Clayhas omitted on important ingredient. Ample provisionis to be made for the recovery of Southern slavesbut none for the recovery of NORTHERN CITIZENS. Ifthe Constitution gives the Southern planter a right toseize his slave in New York or Massachusetts, equallyexplicit is the grant to citizens of those States to enjoyall the rights of citizenship in South Carolina.Yet, if certain of our citizens, freeholders and electorsat home, think proper to visit that State, a prison isthe only dwelling they are permitted to occupy; andshould the State to which they being send as agentto enquire why they are immured in a jail, and tobring their case before the Supreme Court of theof his life!  ORTHERN ITIZENS. 8. The last item of this grand compromise is virtuallya guaranty that the American slave trade, vileand loathsome as it is, shall be held sacred from prohibitionor obstruction by the federal government forall time to come. The stars and stripes shall foreverprotect each counting vessel that shall be freightedwith human  and despair, and manacled cofflesshall, without molestation, be driven across the continentfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific. The slavetrade in the District, that in, in one single market,Mr. Clay pronounces 'detestable,' and talks withhorror of 'the corteges which pass along our avenuesof mounted heaven beings.' But why this suddenoutburst of indignation against a lawful commerce?Is it dishonorable to call merchandize? Has not Mr.Clay himself proclaimed 'that is property which thelaw makes property?' Why does he dishonor theWashington man-merchants? Is it base to buy andveil human beings? Mr. Clay forgets that this 'detestabletrade' in, in fact; supported by the gentlemanbreeders who call, and the gentleman planters buy. But this trade, which is no 'detestable,'and those cartages, which are so horrible on a verylittle souls, are now to assume a national importance,protested and sanctioned by the government of thewhole republic!  single  national Such, sir, is the magnasti compromise whichas many of our Whig and Democratic politicians, nowthat the elections are over, and the solemn pledgesmade in favor of the Wilmot Proviso supported to beforgotten, are willing to accept as a mighty born tohuman rights, and mighty barrier against the furtherencross of the slave power. In my the only language addressed by there eight resolutions,to the North, in the cry of the horse-leach—GIVE, GIVE. No test can detect in them, no microscopecan make visible the most minute concessionto human liberty. Not one single inch of territorydoes the proposed compromise secure from slavery,that is not already rescued from its power. Not asingle human being will it save from bondage.  elections are over supported   minute The extension of the Missouri line to the P,would at least have rendered all on the north of itfree soil; but says Mr. Clay, most truly, althoughwith a frankness almost insulting to the North, Ifmy, sir, in my place here, that it is much better forthe SOUTH that the whole subject should be upon inboth sides an imaginary line of 36º30 min., thanthat slavery should be interdicted positively north of36º30 min., with freedom to admit or excludes it truthof 36º20 min., at the will of the people!'  OUTH that the whole subject should be upon inboth sides an imaginary line of min., thanthat slavery should be interdicted positively north of min., with freedom to admit or excludes it truthof min., at the will of the people!' But, Mr. Clay unclaimed, 'no earthly power couldinduce me to vote for the positive introduction of slaverynorth or south of that line,' and at this heroicavowal the galleries applauded. But the galleriesare not deeply versed in Southern tactics. Mr. Clayneed apprehend no coercion to extort his reluctantvote for a purpose no one desires or demands. TheSouth have, with one voice, denied the power of Congresseither to prohibit or establish slavery in theterritories. Said Mr. King, of Alabama, in reply,'We ask no act of Congress to carry slavery anywhere. I believer we (Congress) have just as muchright to prohibit slavery in the territories as to carryit there. We have no right to do one or the other.'Other Southern Senators have avowed their concurrenceis the doctrine advanced by Mr. King. HenceMr. Clay's defiance of any power on earth to makehim do what nobody wants him to do, was, at least, arhetorical flourish. positive But, if this pretended compromise is, as I extend,a full and unqualified surrender of all the demands ofthe North, why did certain ultra Southern object toit? A show of resistance might have been deemedpolitic, as tending to make Northern men supposethere must be something granted to them, althoughthey could not tell what. It may also exit the partypurposes of some, to prolong the present agitation,that they may manufacture more patriotism for theSouthern m; and lately, if any really wish toform a  to republic, in which they expect to havemore power than they now enjoy, they will, of course,reject all concessions, however grant. But it is incrediblethat the more slaveholders, the men who areonly  to upon now markets for the sale oftheir stock, and to require more votes in Congress,should be avenue to a preposition that offers them allthey have ever ended, and all that Congress can givethem, with the exception of the suppression of theright of petition, and commonship of the Post Offers,and them are not now in issue.    stock right But we are told that unless we yield to the demandsof the slaveholders, they will dissolve theUnion. And what are these demands, which Mr.Clay admits we have full right to ? Why,that a small holy of men,  probably 100,000,*shall be at liberty, for their own aggran, to blight with the curse of slavery our vast south of 36º20 min., and whatever portionof Mexico it shall hereafter he found convenientto seize. Thus at a time when cruelty and oppressionare elsewhere giving way before the increasingintelligence and morality of the age, we the modelRepublic, are to be he instruments of extending overillimitable regions now free, a despotism more accruedthan any other known throughout the civilizedworld—a despotism that not only enslaves hebody, but crushes the intellect through which man isenabled to distinguish good from evil—a despotismthat ihilates all rights, sets at naught all the affectionof the heart, and converts a being made inthe large of God into a soulless machine. Tell menot of exceptions,—of some lucky chatted, like Mr.Clay's negro referred to in his speech, who, in hister's we4ll stored kitchen, hugs his chain, laughsand grows far. He is but a vendible commodity;and to-morrow's sun may behold him toiling underthe , his wife given to another, and his childrenwith pigs and mules sold at auction to the highestbidder. Tell me not of exceptions—'the kind owner'may at any moment be exchanged by death or debts,for the hardened, remorseless task-master, and thelaw sanctions every villainy perpetrated upon theslave.†. No, my dear sir, I cannot give my consent,and I hope it will not be given for me by my representative,to curse a vast empire with such an institution,and to doom unborn millions to its unutterableabominations, even to save our Southern brothersfrom the sin and fully of founding a new Republic (!)upon the denial of human rights, and of renderingthemselves a bye-word, a proverb and a reproach amongall the nations of the earth. I value the favorof my God and the salvation of my soul too much totake a part or let in such great wickedness. Most fullydo I agree with Mr. Clay, that Congress has no moreconstitutional authority over slavery in the Statesthan in the Island of Cuba; and most fully do I agreewith the admission in his speech, but not to be foundin his resolutions, of the right of Congress to excludeslavery from the conquered territories. Hence inmy opinion, the refusal to exercise this right, evento preserve the Union, would be a CRIME in the sightof God and man. I entertain no apprehension of theseverance of the Union for this cause, but should thefew slaveholders, and he vast multitude of southernpeople, who have no interest in slavery, in their madnessseparate from us, upon them will rest the sin,and upon them and their children will fall its punishment.Let us do what God commands, and leave toHim the consequences.     *       † not to be foundin his resolutions Yours truly, WILLIAM JAY. * A late census in Kentucky reveals the fact, thatthe slaveholders in that State own on an average 22slaves.
