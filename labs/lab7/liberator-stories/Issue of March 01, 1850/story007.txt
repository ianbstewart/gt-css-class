 ☞'Yes' it cannot be denied—the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of theiramount to the Constitution, three special provisions tosecure the perpetuity of their dominion over theirslaves. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African slave trade; the record wasthe stipulation to surrender fugitive slaves—an engagementpositively prohibited by the laws of God,delivered from Sinai; and thirdly, the execution fatalto the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor slaves—for articles of merchandize, underthe name of persons. . . . The reciprocal operationupon the government of the nation is, to establish anartificial majority in the slave representation over thatof the free people, in the American Congress, andhereby to make the PRESERVATION, PROPAGATIONAND PERPETUATION OF SLAVERY THEVITAL AND, ANIMATING SPIRIT OF THE NATIONALGOVERNMENT.'—JOHN QUINCY ADAM.
