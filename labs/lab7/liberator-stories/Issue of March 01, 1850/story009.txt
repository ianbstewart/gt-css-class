 The Joint Special Committee, to whom was referredso much of the Governor's address as relates tothe exclusion of Negro slavery from the newly acquiredterritory of the United States; also, certainresolutions of the Legislature of Ohio, relative tothe acquisition and control of foreign territory byor the Legislature of Virginia, upon the subject offugitive slaves; also, certain resolutions of theLegislature of Connecticut, upon the subject ofslavery; also, certain resolutions of the Legislatureof Missouri, upon the subject of slavery; also,certain resolution concerning slavery, introducedinto the House of Representatives, by Mr. Wilson,of Natick, January 11, 1850; also, an order onthe subject of instructing our Senators to voteagainst the compromise resolutions recently preventedto the Senate, dated February 4, 1850, Segto present the following.  In considering the subject submitted to them, yourcommittee do not deem it necessary to enforce theirconclusions by elaborate argument or extensive historicalresearch. The rights and duties of the Statesof this Union, growing out of the unhappy fact ofslavery, are simple and obvious, resting upon acknowledgedprinciples of law and government, and easilycomprehended by every mind, not warped by sophistryor maddened by fanaticism. It is well knows that he Constitution of the UnitedStates embodies certain compromises upon the subjectof slavery. It was believed by the eminent menwho shared in its formation, and urged its acceptanceupon the people, that without these compromises itnever could have been adopted; and it was also believedby them, that the union of the states under theConstitution was well worth the price of these concessions.There is no doubt that these views of theframers of the Constitution have always been, andare new, sustained by an immense majority of thepeople of the United States, who have been indebted,under Heaven for their unexampled growth and prosperity,to the wise provisions of that inestimable instrument. At the time of the adoption of the Constitution,there were six slave-holding states, and seven freestates; though in some of these letter, slavery wasrecognized as a legal institution. Although, at thatperiod, there was free sensibility to the wrongs andsufferings of humanity than there is at present, yetno one was then found so perverse in opinion, or sowanting in natural feeling, as to say one word in itsdefence. It was lamented by all as a deplorable evil,and by none more energetically and unequivocally,than by the leaders of public opinion, in what arenow the slave-holding states. But in the course of the sixty years of our Nationallife, the subject of slavery has assured new andimportant aspects. Under the fostering influence ofliberal institutions, the whole country has made; unexampledprograms in wealth and prosperity, and,with the general growth of the country, there hasbeen a corresponding increase in the members ofthat unhappy class, in whom alone our increasingwealth and power can awaken no connections of prideand satisfaction. The are of slavery has been graduallyextended by the admission of new slave-holdingstates, under circumstances too familiar to thosewho are acquainted with the history of the country,to be here recapitulated. Of the thirty states whichnew form our confederacy, fifteen are free states andfifteen are slaveholding states. Of these, the formercontain an aggregate of population considerablysuperior to that of the latter; and we are fifty entitledto say, that no argument in favor of slavery canbe drawn from the comparative condition of the Northand the South, in material civilization, and moral andmental cultivation. Within a recent period, we have acquired, by with Mexico, the territories of New Mexicoand California, comprising a region of more than fivehundred thousand square miles, equal in extent toten or twelve states of the size of New York. Thefuture destiny of this territory throws a responsibilityupon the whole country, and the Common wealthof Massachusetts will not shrink from the performanceof a duty which it imposes.  Since the adoption of the Constitution, importantchanges have also takes place in the general sentimentsof the civilized world, upon the subject ofslavery. The progress of Christianity, the spreadof knowledge, the increase of benevolent and philanthropicfeeling, and the diffusion of liberal principles,have created throughout Christendom a publicopinion strongly adverse to the existence of slavery,which is constantly expressing itself in the languageof warning, encouragement, expostulation and rebuke.To this formation of this general sentiment, the pulpithas lent its voice of authority, and the  itsirrble influence. Eloquence has swelled it byall its  of power and percussion, and poetry hascommanded it by the magic of its . To thiswidely diffused public opinion we  be if we , had would not be if we That of late years there has been  the freestates, a growing sensibility to the wrongs and evilsof slavery, is a foot which no one can deny, andwhich no right-minded and right-hearted person willregret.          This opposition to slavery is so strongly felt at theNorth, that it has formed a glass or party of men, notnumerous, but considerable from their zeal, theireloquence, and their courage, who openly assail theConstitution of the United Sates, on account of thecompromises which it contains, and candidly renouncetheir allegiance to the Union, because of theprotection which it gives to slavery. Such opinions,it need hardly be said, can find no echo in the Legislatureof Massachusetts, of no member could entertainthem without having committed perjury, and weare therefore not called upon to contains into orcontrovert them. On he other hand, there have been found a fewpersons at the South, who have had the hardihood toknow that slavery is in itself a commendable institution,essential to the ideal excellence of a republicanfrom of government, and in which the happinessand improvement of the African race are best to besecured and maintained. We believe that thesemonstrous opinions are not generally entertained,even by slaveholders themselves. We cannot thinkthat even slavery has so far confounded the essentialdistinctions between right and wrong, and donesuch violence alike to  and humanity. But wedo believe that there is a class of slaveholders at theSouth, and probably an increasing clams, who, alarmedby the growing agitation of the subject at theNorth, and stung by the irritating language in whichit is so often discussed, really do think that theirrights and interests would be safer if the Union weredissolved, and they were left to protect their propertyin their own way, without molestation or interference.We need not say that we believe these opinions tobe entirely mistaken, but we have little doubt thatthey are sincerely held by a class of men, not numerous,perhaps, but exerting considerable influencefrom their ability, wealth, and social position.  These two extremes of opinion on the subject ofslavery find their organs of expression in the pressand the political and deliberative assemblies of thecountry. While we deprecate and lament the violentlanguage of those persons at the North, whosezeal against slavery is so far without discretion asto lead them to favor disunion, we should be doingthem injustice, if we did not recognize a distinctionbetween them and the pro-slavery zealots at theSouth, who defend the principle of slavery, demandits extension, and look forward to its perpetual existence,with complacency and satisfaction. Theformer are fairly entitled to such measure of respectas may be claimed by men who are fearlessly anddevotedly pursuing a noble object, but not wisely,not gently, not patiently, and therefore, not successfully.But a man zealous for slavery, in the abstract,who wishes to extend it where it does not exist, andto perpetuate it where I does exist, is a moral monster,whose very existence gives stronger testimonyagainst the institution, than argument or eloquencecan supply. Now we hold, that under our institutions, a manis lawfully entitled to write or speak against the governmentof the country under which he lives. Hehas a legal right, for instance, to argue in favor ofmonarchy, in established church, and an hereditarynobility, and against republican institutions in general.So he has a right to say that the Constitutionof the United States is all wrong, and that it oughtto be set aside, and a better one substituted in itsplace. We hold, that to this right of discussion,there is no limit short of a breach of the peace, oran overt act of treason. But, on the other hand, we are bound to make anelection. We must accept the whole of the Constitutionor none of it. We have no right to take itsadvantages and reject its inconveniences. We haveno right to assent to so much as we approve, and rejectthe rest. We have no right to say that a particularprovision is void, simply because we do notlike it. The Legislature of Massachusetts gives its adherenceto the Constitution of the United States, and tothe whole of it. We represent a law-abiding andorder-loving community. We hold this to be no reproach,but an honor. We reverence the framers ofthe Constitution. We value and cherish the instrumentitself, and the Union which it has maintained,and we mean  at the, so excised all the rights which the Constitutionsecures to us, as a member of this Union.   The provisions of the Constitution on the subjectof slavery are to be construed fairly, but strictly, becausethey are opposed to personal liberty and to naturalright. Especially no inference in favor of slaverycan be drawn from the silence of the Constitution.These principles of interpretation are undeniable,and will not be questioned by any intelligentjurist, even at the South. The Opinions of the people of Massachusetts, intheir Legislative capacity, upon the subject of slavery,have been repeatedly and emphatically expressed,and it may be asked, why they are again proclaimed.To this we reply, that our attention hasbeen called to the subject, not only by the address ofhis Excellency the Governor of the Commonwealth,whose suggestions deserve and will receive our mostrespectful consideration, but because we believe, thatin view of the destiny of the newly acquired territoryof the United States, a crisis is approaching, whichrequires a mutual understanding and co-operation amongthe friends of law, liberty, order and progress,throughout the whole country. There are many points of view from which thesubject of slavery may be contemplated. It has itsreligions, its moral, its social and economical aspects.These may be safely left to the various formsand modes of expression which the press, the pulpit,and the popular assembly supply. Bu we have todeal with it solely in its political relations. We arenot a debating society or an anti-slavery convention.Our business is not to create public opinion, but togive it direction and expression. We are sent hereto make laws for the State of Massachusetts, and,incidentally, to express the sense of Massachusettsupon points of national interest, when it can be donewith propriety and effect. In the performance of this duty, as of all legislativeduties, it becomes us to act with firmness, temperanceand discretion. We are not to take counselof our passions, but of our reason and judgment.Even the sympathies and the sensibilities, thoughthey may supply motive and impulse, are unsafeguides and counselors in the conduct of affairs. Werepudiate all extravagance, exaggeration and over-statementon this subject, and all other subjects.We will not stoop to the language of menace or reproach.We do no believe that any good has, orever will, come from the crimination or recriminationinto which men so readily fall, when they discuss thisquestion. We do not believe that men are made betterby rousing their passions, or that a state of constantirritation is favorable to the growth of virtue orwisdom. We leave vehement denunciation, intemperateabuse, and threats of disunion, to those whothink such exhibitions seemly and profitable; whoeither believe that they "do well to be angry," or elsefor politic ends, counterfeit a passion which they donot feel. In our opinion the subject of slavery, fromthe existing nature of the topics it necessarily involves,peculiarly required the application of wisdom,discretion and forbearance. Entertaining these views, your committee wouldexpress their entire assent to the opinions of his Excellency,the Governor of the Commonwealth, uponthe introduction of Negro Slavery into the territoriesof the Union which are now free. We view withthe strongest reprobation, those men who have so fardegenerated from the spirit of their fathers, as tomaintain that the existence of slavery is in itself agood, to be perpetuated and extended; and, on theother hand, we have no sympathy with the party thatdenies the virtue of patriotism and rejects the Constitutionof our country. We abide by the letter andspirit of that instrument. The letter forbids us frominterposing directly with a domestic institution, sanctionedby the laws of States whose jurisdiction withintheir own limits is supreme and exclusive, and forthe evil consequences of which we are in no wise responsible,while the spirit should unite all parties inpreventing its ext one inch beyond its existinglimits.  We entertain no doubt of the power of Congressto exclude slavery from the territory of the UnitedStates which is new free, and we also entertain nodoubt that they ought to exercise that power. Theargument of the slaveholders, that to shut out themand their property from a region acquired by thecommon blood and treasure of the whole country,would be unequal, oppressive, and unjust, is answeredby a simple statement of the legal character ofslavery, which owes its existence to positive municipallaw, to oppressive natural right, and not recognizedby the common law. The argument involvesa bagging of the question as to the nature of propertyin slaves. It  it for granted that the slave-holderhas the  and right to his slave that he has to his  or .This  deny. We admit that  locallimits, he has the same right. But this is a peculiarand exceptional . We are new asked to enlargethe exception. But we prefer to leave the ruleas it is.         But we are told that the exclusion of slavery these territory will be followed by a dissolution ofthe Union, and Massachusetts and the other States are warned to recede from the ground whichthey have taken on the subject, in view of the consequenceswhich may excuse if they adhere to it.   In reply to this suggestion, we say in the first place,that we doubt the fact. We believe that is any eventthe Union will be maintained. We believe that thefanatics of the North and the fanatics of the South,who, standing at the opposite poles of opinion on thissubject, agree in thinking that the objects they aimsat would be best accomplished by a dissolution ofthe Union, are not sustained by anything approachingto a majority in either section of the country.We believe, further, that many of these who aremost loud and flippant in the agitation of this subject,are encouraged by a secret consciousness, ofthis fact, and that they themselves would be amongthe list to take the responsibility of dissolving theUnion were it in their power to do so. Discontentis a clamorous, and content a silent, quality. Toborrow a celebrated illustration, a few restless grass-hoppersin a field make more noise then a herd ofcattle feeding and reposing in tranquility. Thegreat body of reasonable men who are attached to theUnion, are a quiet class, neither writing nor making speeches, but who would act with vigorand promptness, if necessary. We think that theSouth, if left to themselves, would submit to the willof the majority on this subject, as on other subjectsof general interest, but we also have little doubt thatit is possible, by a course of unwise and exasperatingagitation, to good them into measures as disastrous tothemselves as to us.  In the next place, we say that, with the views weentertain upon the extension of slavery, we are compelledto lay aside all consideration of the consequenceswhich may flow from an adherence to theseviews. We feel a strong attachment to the UnionIt has made as a powerful, a prosperous, and ahappy people. We value our common recollectionsand our common hopes. We look back with prideupon our great past, and forward, with hope to ouranimating future. From the consequences whichwould follow a violent disruption of the Union, wewould gladly avert our thoughts. But in that disastrousevent, we should have at least the consolationof a conscience void of offence. But in giving ourassent to the extension of slavery into regions nowfree, we should feel that we were guilty of a sin beforeGod and man, for which there is no compensationand no equivalent. The sting of self-reproachwould make our material prosperity of little value.The consciousness of wrong-doing would pursue usthrough all the paths of life, and impair the flavor ofour daily bread. If we are called on to do wrong,we prefer to suffer wrong. From the language sometimes used by public menat the South, both at home and in Congress, we shouldinfer that our Southern brethren really supposed thatopposition to slavery at the North was confined tofanatics and disorganizers. We assure them thatsuch is not the case. The feeling against slaverymay be said to be universal among the people ofthe New England States. It is the sentiment of reasonable,moderate, and judicious men, who hold noextreme opinions, and would shrink from all intemperateaction. With those whose lives are governedby moral and religious ideas, it is a deep moraland religious conviction, and as such, is entitled tothe respect of slaveholders themselves. Such personsbelieve slavery to be an institution which arrestsall moral, religious, and intellectual growth inthe enslaved race, and is no wise favorable to suchgrowth in the dominant race. When, therefore, weare asked to consent to the extension of slavery intoregions which are now free, we are asked to do thatwhich morality and religion alike forbid. We canonly be convinced that we are wrong in this sentimentby being persuaded that slavery is an institutionnot opposed to morality and religion. Much as werespect the eloquence and ability of our Southernbrethren, we doubt whether they can ever slake ourconvictions on this point. In conclusion, we beg leave to cite, for the considerationof the  'be  of one whom thesewill summit to be a sign security. Mr. Jefferson, iswriting upon the subject of slavery, makes use of thestriking expression, 'I tremble for my country whenI reflect that God is just.' So we, reflecting thatGod is just, should tremble for ourselves and ourchildren, if we sided in the extension of an institutionwhich we believe to be opposed to all the attributesof God. The temporal misfortunes, which afirm adherence to duty may bring upon us, we shallendeavor to bear with the patience and submissionwith which it is our duty to receive the chastisementsof divine Providence. But we will not buy temporalblessings with the price of what we deem wrong-doing.We will endure the shadow of sorrow, but notthe stain of guilt.   For the Committee, GEO.S. HILLARD, Chairman. Chairman.
