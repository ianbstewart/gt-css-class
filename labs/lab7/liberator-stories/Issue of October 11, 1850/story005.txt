 A few days since, we recorded the arrest of a coloredman in this city, James Hallet by name, on acharge of being a fugitive from service,—his trialand conviction on that charge, before the U.S.Commissioner,—and his consequent surrender tohis owner, Mrs. Mary Brown, of Baltimore. Theadvocates of a 'higher law,' or rather of no lawexcept such as they may individually approve, predictedthat however many enactments might be passedby Congress, the provision of the Constitution requiringthe surrender of fugitive slaves could notbe enforced in the Northern States. Yet almostwithin a stone's throw of the spot where was issuedthe declaration, that 'No enactments will be of anyuse'—'Every yeoman along the valleys will run theslave and trip the shameless hunter'—James Halletwas tried and convicted of being a slave, and wasremoved from the city in the broad face of day, to theplace whence be fled, without the least attempt atresistance on the part of prophet or any of hissubordinates or dependents. The decree of theCommissioner was according to law and the Constitution,and for ourselves, we rejoiced, that after a disgracefulinterval, the law and the Constitution wereshown to be paramount; and we said so in plainwords. But did we rejoice that James Hallet, a respectableman and a member of the MethodistChurch, was remanded back to slavery, leaving behindhim a wife and three children to lament hishard fate and their own? Very far from it. In itself,this thing was contrary to all the sentiments of ournature; but yet it was a calamity not to be namedthe same day with the subversion of the law andthe Constitution, and the solemnly plighted faith ofthe nation. The majesty of the law having beenvindicated, the solemnly plighted faith of the nationhaving been redeemed, mob-law having been frownedinto silence, and its abettors put to shame, weare prepared to units in any honorable efforts for theliberation of Hallet, and his resolution to his familyand business.
