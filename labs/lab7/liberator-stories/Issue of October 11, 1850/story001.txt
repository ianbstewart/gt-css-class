 THE V.S. CONSTITUTION 'A COVENANT WITH DEATH,AND AN ASSESSMENT WITH 'HELL' ☞'Yes! it cannot be denied—the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of theirassent to the Constitution, three special provisions tosecure the perpetuity of their dominion over theirslaves. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African slave trade; the second wasthe stipulation to surrender fugitive slaves—an engagementpositively prohibited by the laws of God,delivered from Sinus; and thirdly; the execution, fatalto the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor slaves—for articles of merchandise, underthe name of persons. . . To call government thus constituteda democracy, is to insult the understanding ifmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slavery. In reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of the nation is to establish an artificialmajority in the slave representation over that of thefree people, in the American Congress, and therebyto make the PRESERVATION, PROPAGATIONAND PERPETUATION OF SLAVERY THE VITALAND ANIMATING SPIRIT OF THE NATIONALGOVERNMENT.—JOHN QUINECY ADAMS.
