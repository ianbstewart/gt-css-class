We have carefully considered what you have saidand proposed; and, as we understand the matter, youare now upon the same ground as when, twenty yearsago, you crunched nullification. Now, as then, in spite of local prejudice and factious,sound Constitutional and National principleswill prevail; and if the voice of general commendationis occasionally broken up by impotent censure,it will not disturb you, because it must remind youthat it is faction, and not the Union, which is overthrows. Respectfully, your friend and fellow-citizens, R, PRICE, and 127 others.   RICE
