 The colored people had a grand time last evening,at Zion's Chapel, in Church street. Their objectwas, to denounce the fugitive slave law; and thiswas done with hearty good will, or, we should say,malediction. The steam would have been well up, without anyextraneous elements of excitement; but what addeda special interest to the occasion, and raised the temperamentto blood heat, was the announcement, madeby Mr. Downing, that the wife of James Hallet (thefugitive slave who has returned to his owner in Baltimore,a few days since, under a process of law,) haddied yesterday, of grief and convulsions. died yesterday, of grief and convulsions. This fitted the measure of indignation which burnedin the become of all present, against a law which,besides its other abominations, could produce suchtotal effects. In the favor of moment, a contributionwas called for, to defray the expenses of thefuneral, and about $20 was collected. y after, information was resoled that it wasall a mistake about her dying of , or inany  way, and that she was as well as even.This was a damper upon the enthusiasm of the casion;but the money was already collected, andseeing it could not be applied lost now to defray herfuneral expenses, it was very properly decided to applyit to her living expenses. The meeting adjourned.     Mrs. Hallett was in our office yesterday, accompaniedby her mother and a colored man. She appearedin good health, (though of course distressedat the misfortune of her husband,) and we hope shewill live a thousand years. She certainly shall, ifhis return will have that effect.
