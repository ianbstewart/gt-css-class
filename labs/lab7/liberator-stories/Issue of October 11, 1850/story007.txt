 The public have been treated in some bugbearstories upon this subject, which have afforded an excellentoccasion to a certain claim of persons forletting off a portion of the steam which has been accumulatingin their indignant insiders for some timepast. Slave-catchers were among us, forsooth! Nobody,it is free, had seen any such animal, or heardof any one who had seen him. But it was a finechance to raise storm; accordingly as storm wasraised. The Atlas of yesterday made the followingstatement:— We understand that proportions have already beenmade to man holding after in this city, to make arrestsof sundry fugitives who are supposed to be here,but the temptation has not yet been strong enough. Who these 'men holding office' are nobody cantell. The United States Marshal knows nothing ofthese 'propositions,' nor his deputy nor his clerks, norany other public functionary whom we have beenable to see. These is not the slightest evidence thatthere is a slave-catcher in the State of Massachusetts. At Springhold, a most ridiculous scene was enacted.A telegraphic dispatch from that place, whichwe published yesterday, represented the inhabitantsas out of their wits with fright,—slave-catchers werethere, too! The abolition hot-heads were arming tothe teeth, determined to make bloody work. Inflammatoryhand-bills were circulated, and a meetingwas convened at the Town Hall, when sundry personstalked very valiantly, and passed resolutions, aswe understand, nullifying the Fugitive Slave Law!The tempest in the tea-pot, however, soon blew over.It became known that all this hurly-burly about slave-catcherswas occasioned by the arrival of MarshalDevens in that neighborhood to serve a civil processupon a barber! nullifying Stores were also circulated of slave-catchers inWorcester and other places. None of there taleshave the slightest foundation. All the excitementhas been got up by agitators, for their own privatebenefit.
