 In no country is the world can slavery be noprofitably employed as in California. California. 'The opinion that slavery can never he profitablyemployed in this region, is board upon the eager and  cannot be pro. Thisspecies of labor has never been profitably employedexcept in the production of there articles. Let ussuppose the negroes of a larger  plantationperted from the  the of California, and are the difference of their earningsin one place from the other. I have never been in acotton-growing State, and don't know what would becalled a 'larger plantation of negroes'; but I supposethere are many plantations with 300 and 400 fieldnegroes. The profits accruing form the labor of eachnegro on a plantation, over the expenses, must bevery small. Say such negro earns $75 over andshore his expenses; than 300 would earn $22,500.This must be a larger estimate than the owners ofplantations generally realize. Suppose, then, those900 negroes to work one year in the mines, and markthe difference. Under intelligent management, withpractical men in mining for overseers, each negromust average over $3000 a year; making theenormous annual sun total of $900,000.        Mining is not only very trying to the constitutionon account of the hard work, but it is also very unhealthy,Digging deep under ground, more thanhalf of which is in very cold water in valleys andgouges where in the  the thermometer in theshade stands at 110, cannot he otherwise than unhealthy.Now, it would be a very easy and pleasantway for a Southern  to pees his time, with overseersunder him directing to urging forward thenegroes, while he would have nothing to do but toeat and smoke his favorite tobacco, drink his Monongahelawhiskey, bag and secure his gold, and be a jolly,whole-ed, and at the same time chivalrous fellow.This situation would give him time to study thephilosophy of life, and learn to perfection his part in'The Force of Politics,' and so at the rehearsals atWashington, these dignified men of leisure wouldhave their parts much better learned than the men ofthe North. hard work cold water    The people of the South have seen this goldenchance for making fortunes pass almost beyond theirreach, and have grouped firmly what re, andthat their plans will in the main succeed, I have nodoubt. what re  Planters in various parts of the South have madecontracts with their slaves to this effect? They areto accompany their masters to the mines and washfor a specified time, at the end of which time theyare to have their freedom. If such masters stay oneyear uninterrupted in the mines, they will probablymake large fortunes. But they may not be permittedto wash in the mines, it whites will not be likelyto labor by the side of negroes. Slavery, in the estimationof white man, degrades labor. Whatthen? If slavery shall be seen to be profitable andimportant, it is not improbable that Northern whiteswill avail themselves of it. There is but little principle in the mines. It isnot impossible for California yet to be a slave State.It will be nothing but a mining State for many, manylong years; and it is to be the grand depot for all indebt, all in disgrace, for all the discontented. Theyall want to make money, and very few care how, orin what way it comes. I verily believe, if the peopleof California were of the opinion that they couldmake money by it, they would be ready to voteslavery into the constitution to narrow. Alreadymen have slaves in the mines at work, and I have nodoubt, before the rainy season sets in, there will bethousands in various parts of the mining districts.All Southern man stand as one to assert their rightto introduce slaver, not withstanding the constitution.' how assert their right SLAVERY IN CLAIFORNIA. A late number of theFederal Union coun the following facts in regardto the employment and profitableness of slave laborin California: LAVERY IN LAIFORNIA.  A friend form Newton county informs us that hehas just received a letter from his brother, now inCalifornia, formerly a captain of a company of TexasRangers, which states that the writer has now withhim on the Sacramento river, thirty-two slaves engagedin digging gold, who have made for him, eachon average, from 15 to $20 per day, since the 10thof March last. The negroes are from 40 to 50 yearsof age. They give him no trouble, not does any oneinterfere with them.
