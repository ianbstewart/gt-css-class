 Extract from a speech delivered by GEORGE THOMPSON,Esq., in Manchester, England, before the abolitionof British West India slavery:— EORGE HOMPSON I am very friendly to compensation. I shouldlike the negro to be compensate. (Applause.) Ishould like them to show how much we owe thenegro for his hitherto uncompensated toil; whatdebt we owe to Africa, where no wind for ages hasgone over her plains, without gathering up the sighsof bleeding, broken hearts; where there is no sandthat has not been steeped with team or the blood ofcaptured victims. I should like to see what compensationwe owe to the negro: how much to thataged man, tottering on the brink of the grave,whose limbs are now growing feeble, after years ofunrequited toil;—how much to that poor womantorn from her infant, and set to labor in the field.if, indeed, a valuation can be put upon the naturalfeelings of a mother towards the offspring of herbody; and then I should like to strike a balance betweenthe compensation due to the negro, and thecompensation doe to the planter. Eloquent speechesand arguments are made on the rights of theplanter in the House of Commons, and echoed inthe major and minor pro-slavery periodicals of theday. And at this moment, if Parliament were sitting,some West India partisan might be making aneloquent speech in favor of himself, and saying,'Take care of the planter: only think of the melancholycondition of the planter's wife if you reducehis income, by not giving him power to raise largecrops and dispose of them. Give additional bountiesto his sugar; lay more prohibitory duties onfree-grown produce. Mind that you protect theplanter.' Next morning, some lady sipping her ten,and reading the Morning Post, might say, 'Dearme, what an amiable speech! How he pities theplanter! Really, I feel inclined to pity the planter,too.' (Laughter.) And thus all the lady's sympathywould be on the side of the planter, and shewould think nothing of the slave. planter Morning Post
