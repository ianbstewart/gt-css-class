 Extract from the 'Declaration of Sentiments' ofthe National Anti-Slavery Convention, adopted inPhiladelphia, December, 1833:— We maintain that no compensation should begiven to the planters emancipating their slaves— Because it would be a surrender of the great fundamentalprinciple, that man cannot hold propertyin man; Because SLAVERY IS A CRIME, AND THEREFORE ITIS NOT AN ARTICLE TO BE SOLD; LAVERY IS A CRIME, AND THEREFORE ITIS NOT AN ARTICLE TO BE SOLD Because the holders of slaves are not the justproprietors of what they claim;—freeing the slavesis not depriving them of property, but restoring itto the right owner;—it is not wronging the master,but righting the slave—restoring him to himself; Because immediate and general emancipationwould only destroy nominal, not real property: itwould not amputate a limb or break a bone of theslaves, but by infusing motives into their breasts,would make them doubly valuable to the masters asfree laborers; and Because if compensation is to be given at all, itshould be given to the outraged and guiltless slaves,and not to those who have plundered and abusedthem.
