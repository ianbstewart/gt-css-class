 Extract from the recent message of the Governor ofFlorida to the Legislature of that State:â€” 'I think the time has arrived when our peopleshould be a unit in sentiment touching the institutionof Slavery, not only as to its expediency, but asto its morality; and whatever may facilitate the attainmentof this and, I think ought to be encouragedby the Legislature. Not until within the lastquarter of a century had the institution of Slaverybeen made to abide the test of morality laid downin the precepts of the Bible, and until driven to investigation,Southern men were not disposed to gointo it. But after having been violently assailed,and their motives, piety and patrician ruthlessly denounced,some of the great minds of the South boldlytook up the subject, and in a masterly yet truthfulmanner demonstrated from the sacred writingsthat Slavery, as it exists in the Southern States, ismorally right, and ought to be perpetrated. Thespirit of investigation thus a wakened resulted in aradical revolution of sentiment in the Southern mindupon the morality of the institution, and thousandsbecame its zealous advocates who had previously entertainedserious conscientious scruples which renderedthem lukewarm toward the institution, if negativelyopposed to it. This spirit of investigationought to be encouraged, and I think that the passageof a law securing every person in the possessionof at least one slave free from molestation, wouldtend materially to that end. It would inspires everyman with an ambition to own at least one slave, andI am clearly of opinion that the result of such a lowwould be to make hundreds of our citizens actualslave-owners who, without some such encouragement,would probably never own a lave. unit in sentiment morally right
