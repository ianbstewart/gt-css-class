 The Barnstable Patriot bates anti-slavery peopleas the devil is supposed to hate holy water, andconsequently is out with a flaming appeal to thesectarian prejudices of many good people against thepeculiar notions of Garrison, Parker and Phillips.Now parker is not half so great an 'infidel' to thereception of all Christianizing influences as Mr. S.B. Phinney is. Parker gave Ellen Crafts a Bible,when he married her, for her spiritual guide, whileat the same time he put a pistol into the hands ofHenry Box Brown, to protect him from the graspof the slave-hunter. Mr. Phinney, on the contrary,supports a party who uphold a system making itcriminal to teach black children how to read theBible. What is an 'infidel'? It is this, accordingto the popular estimation: 'I believe certaindoctrines; if you deny them, you are an infidel.'Now Parker denies a good deal that most peoplefirmly believe: hence he is called an infidel. Onthe other hand, Parker believes a good deal thatmost other people deny: hence he calls them infidelsto his belief! And so each party is 'infidel'to the other. That is all this cry of infidelityamounts to. Mr. Garrison is a practical Christian—thetrouble is, he believes in imitating theSavior so closely, that it is difficult for people tofollow him—hence a sheep way of getting over thedifficulty is to cry 'infidel.' As to Mr. Phillips, heis a member of the strict Orthodox society. He believesthe Church should make war against slavery and all unrighteousness.  His brethren do not findit for their interest to keep up with him, so theysometimes call him 'infidel,' though a purer-heartedman does not live. Patriot them It is very common for one Christian sect to callanother infidel—the Turks call all Christians 'infidels'—but is amounts to nothing.
