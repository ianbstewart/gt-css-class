 We have, of late, on more than one occasion, advertedis the foot, that London just now someone withthe  of American slavery. We need notrepeat, the expression of those feelings with whichwe regard men, who, while participating in the guiltof holding their follow-creatures in the chains of acruel and degrading bo, make  professionsof  to the Divine Founder of theChristian faith,. With feelings of still more ,am and indignation do we regard those.Evangelical divines, who are either the holders ofslaves or the  advocates of slavery.—From the contemplation of the character and conductof such men, we turn away in sorrow end of such so advert for a moment or two tovery differed class of Americans, when the GreatExhibition, and other , have at this time attractedto England.          The readers of this journal need not now to betold, that for more then twenty years there havebeen a noble band of men and women in the UnitedStates, within their head quarters in Boston. who,under the name of Abolitionists, have been incessantly. with a seal, a courage, and a ,which, all circumstances con, we hold to bealmost ralloled in history, for the liberation ofthe 3,000,000 human beings who are held its in the Southern States of America.      Our limited space forbids the attempt even toglazer at the  which this chosen handof Abolitionists have made, and the true nobility ofsoul they have displayed int he pursuit of the greatobject, on the achievement of which they havetheir hearts. We refer our readers for more detalinformation than our opens will allow as to to an article from the pen of Mi M,which ap twelve years ago in the WRumens, under the title of The  Age inthe United States. So much lofty principle, such of evatedal such real nobility of nature, such  of purpose, such display of moralcourage, and as much self- have hardlyover before have witnessed in        WRumens  The  Age  the United States.

This noble army offemale soldiers in the cause of  justice andsuffering humanity. committed themselves to thechiefinship of Men. Champen. Of this lady, MissM thus speaks:—                Before we pretend, it is necessary to say a fewwords upon the meet remarkable of those women—the understood other of the bus he whees titles standat the head of our article.

But wefurther to any all we would otherwise do on the subjectbecause Mrs. Chapman and her  are atpresent in this .             What Mrs.  was in the Female &anti-SlaverySociety of Boston, Mr. William Lloyd Garrisonhas been among the male Abolitionist of AHe has been, and in the life and soul of themovement.

We now find that the most careful juggingmade, he is observed of of those who are rather his  free—but by in a man of  character in allthe relations of life, and that he is not only a man ofca and  of but of the purest among.

But let us add, that the same  for truth andjustice which prompts our vindication of Mr. Garrisonfrom the  againsthim, demands that we should admit—and in doingso, us deeply  the fast—that his views on subjects are not in  with divinerevolution. He rejects  other the claims of the to the character of an inspired book.Now let it be distinctly  that we do notquarrel with Mr. Garrison, and any other man, for hisopinions on religious  However much theymay differ own.
