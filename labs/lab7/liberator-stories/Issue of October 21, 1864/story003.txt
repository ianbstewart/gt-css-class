 BY. C.H. WALKER Who, in our prosperous days, was heThat claimed our nation's unityCould not exist half slave, half free!   ABE LINCOLN. BE INCOLN. Who breaks his faith with friend and foe?Who gives us war with all its woe?Who yields the doctrine of Monroe?   ABE LINCOLN. BE INCOLN. Who sets the laws and rights at naughtOur noble sires so dearly bought,And spurns the precepts that they taught?   ABE LINCOLN. BE INCOLN. Who unto bastilles has access,Lays shackles on our speech and press,His cherished schemes to give success?   ABE LINCOLN. BE INCOLN. Who vainly strives with envious aimTo rob McClellan of his fame,And blot that noble patriot's name?   ABE LINCOLN. BE INCOLN. Who untold millions daily spends,Unites his foes, divides his friends,And comfort to Jeff. Davis lends? (!!!)   ABE LINCOLN. BE INCOLN. Who now puts forth the traitorous creedThat till the Southern blacks are freed,Our gallant sons must fight and bleed?   ABE LINCOLN. BE INCOLN. Whom, in November, will we "swap"(Though swift the stream, the "hoss" we'll drop.)His bloody course that we may stop?   ABE LINCOLN. BE INCOLN. Waterboro Centre, Me. â€”Boston Post.
