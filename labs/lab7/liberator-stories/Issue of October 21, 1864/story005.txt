 Hon. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, whose loyaltysince the rebellion broke out has been of themost equivocal character; in a recent letter to a Copperheadgathering, makes the following patriotic (?)impeachment of President Lincoln:— In the early days of Mr. Lincoln's administration,I lost almost all hope of a successful termination ofthe rebellion, whilst he was at the head of the Government,and this, the merest hope, is now whollyextinguished. His infirmity of purpose—his unsteadinessin any policy—his once expressed disliketo radicalism—his subsequent adoption of its worstfeatures—his ignorant and mischievous interferencewith our military campaigns—his appointment, oftenagainst advice, of high military officers of notoriousincompetency—his frequent and nearly fatal changeof commanders—his abandonment of the, before,uniform practice of his predecessors of cabinet consultations—his permission of dishonorable dissensionsamong its members, displaying itself constantly,to his knowledge, before others, and often, as it isknown, in his presence, in personal abuse of eachother—his obstinate and reckless disregard of thewishes of his political friends, communicated to himon one occasion in the solemn form of a committee,representing, as he was aware, nine-tenths if notevery friend he had in Congress; and again, andrecently, expressed in terms not to be mistaken, inone of the resolutions of the Convention whichnominated him for re-election; his permitting militaryinterference with elections, virtually subjectingthe ballot to the control of the bayonet; his justifyingarrests without specifications of charges, thoughover and over again demanded, and long continuedimprisonment, and, after release, without trial orexplanation; his tolerating trial, by military commission,of offences made cognizable exclusively byacts of Congress passed since the rebellion, and by thecivil courts; and the virtual confiscation of privateproperty, without even a resort to any mode of trail,and other matters of like illegality and outrage, toomany to detail in a letter, whilst they demonstratehis utter unfitness for the Presidency, give nopromise of a successful result of the contest whilsthe is commander-in-chief of the army and navy,and intrusted, by the power he wields, with theshaping of our peace and war policy. This must bearrested, or, in my opinion, the country will beruined.
