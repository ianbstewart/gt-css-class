 Ara—" When Johnny comes marching home." I. Nest Fourth of March, in sixty-five,Hurrah! hurrah!Old Abe shall from the White House drive,Hurrah! hurrah!And clear the track for Little Mac;And all the Abolition packWill show their heelsWhen Old Abe marches home.        II. McClellan is the people's choice—Their choice, their choice;And all the country will rejoice—Rejoice, rejoice,When Abe the joker leaves the placeHe's filled so long to his disgrace,And once more splits railsAs be goes marching home.        III. Our Little Mac's a Patriot—True blue, true blue!Scorch and Abolition he'llPut through, put through!Until they both shall leave the land,And then our noble, gallant bandOf soldiers braveCan all go marching home.        all —Boston Post.
