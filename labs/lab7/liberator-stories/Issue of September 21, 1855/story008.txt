 Great curiosity is expressed as to the whence Judge Kane could have derived thosevery extraordinary ideas of law embodied in thecare of Passmore Williamson. There can be littledoubt, we think, that the model which ourAmerican Judge placed before himself on that occasionwas the first Chief-Justice of the King'sBench, appointed by Charles II, after his restoration—the first in a series of judicial tools, themost hateful wretches of whom English historymakes mention, employed by Charles II, and hisbrother James in their desperate but fortunatelyunsuccessful attempts to crush the liberties ofthe English nation. Sir Robert the Englishoriginal of our Judge Kane, owed his appointmentto his party zeal much more than to his legalreputation. That zeal he contrived to signalizeduring the three years that he sat on the Bench inthree State trials, the iniquities and outrages ofall three of which our Judge Kane, whether fromhis superior genius or the advantage of his tion,has managed to compress into the single caseof Passmore Williamson.   The first of Foster's three cases was the trial ofSir Henry Vane, who was found guilty of treasonby the help of a convenient action of law verymuch like that by which Passmore Williamsonis made guilty of a false return. As Sir HenryVane had disapproved of the execution ofCharles I, and in fact had actually tried to savethat unhappy monarch's life, the treason chargedupon him was conspiring the death of CharlesII. It was admitted that the prisoner had notmeditated any attempt upon the natural life ofCharles II., but the ground taken by the prosecutionand the Court was, that, by acting underthe authority of the Commonwealth, he had assistedin preventing the true heir from obtainingpossession of the throne, and thereby in pointof law had conspired his death. Vans arguedthat he had acted under the authority of theParliament, and that he came within the spiritof the statute of Henry VII, and of the commonlaw principle, that, no one could ever be calledin question for any acts done by authority of aking in possession, even though he might be ausurper. But the idea of any power in Parliamentwas as abhorrent to Chief-Justice Fosteras the idea of any power in the State of Pennsylvaniais to Judge Kane; and he not only ruledthis defence out of Court, but even representedthe having made it as a reason which proved sufficientwith the king, why no mercy should be extendedto Vane, notwithstanding he came fullywithin the declaration of indemnity made at Breda,in which the king had promised to proceed onlyagainst the 'immediate murderers' of his father. The next case in which Chief-Justice Fosterfigured was that of John Crook and several otherQuakers brought before him for refusing to takethe oath of allegiance, equivalent to which JudgeKane seems to reckon refusing to aid in enforcingthe Fugitive Slave Act. Some passages betweenthe Chief-Justice and John Crook, as givenin the State Trials, might well have been reported,and substantially were so, as between JudgeKane and Passmore Williamson. We quote asfollows: 'FOSTER, C.J.—John Crook, when did you take theoath of allegiance? Crook—Answering this questionin the negative is to accuse myself, which you oughtnot to put me upon. I am an Englishman, and I oughtnot to be taken, nor imprisoned, nor called is question,nor put to answer but according to the law of theland. Foster, C.J.—You are here required to takethe oath of allegiance, and when you have done that,you shall be heard. Crook—You that are Judges onthe bench ought to be my council, not my accusers.Foster, C.J.—We are here to do justice, and are uponour oaths, and we are to tell you what is law, not youus. Therefore, Sirrah, you are too bold. Crook—Sirrah is not a word bming a judge. If I speak loud,it is my zeal for the truth and for the name of the Lord.Mine innocensy makes me bold. Foster, C.J.—It isan evil zeal. Crook—No; I am bold in the name of theLord God Almighty, the everlasting Jehovah, to assertthe truth and stand as a witness for it. Let my be brought forth. Foster, C.J.—Sirrah, you areto take the oath, and here me tender is you. Crook—Let me be cleared of my imprisonment, and then Iwill answer to what is charged against me. I keep aconscience void of  both toward God and towardman. Foster, C.J.—Sirrah, leave your canting.Crook—Is this canting to speak the words of Scripture?Foster, C.J.—It is canting in your mouth, thoughthey are St. Paul's words. Your first denied to takethe oath shall be recorded, and on the around dentalyou bear the penalties of a premuntre, which is theforfeiture of all your estate, if you have say, and imprisonmentduring life.' OSTER Crook Foster, C.J. Crook Foster, C.J. Crook  Foster, C.J. Crook  Foster, C.J. Crook—  Foster, C.J. Crook Foster, C.J. premuntre imprisonmentduring life. Our American Foster, it will be seen, has decidedlyimproved upon this precedent, for insteadof giving Passmore Williamson a secondchance, and the permission asked for by his counselto amend his return, our sharp Judge, Kaneheld him strictly to his first construction 'denial.'He proceeded forthwith to pass the sentence ofimprisonment during his (Judge Kane's) good willand pleasure; and undoubtedly when Wheelerbrings a suit for the value of the negroes, or Williamsonis indicted under the Fugitive Slave ,he stands ready and eager to for his properlyalso.   Crook, in his account of the proceedings, slavesthat having in reply  the Apostle James,the Chief-Justice called on the executioner  stophis mouth, which he did with a dirty cloth and agag. Here again Judge Kane improves upon hismodel. He not only stops Williamson's mouth,but gags his  also. Thank God! there isin three days what was unknown in the timeof Chief-Justice Foster, a press which even judgescannot gag!    The third man which came before Chief-JusticeFoster, and the  of which Judge Kane hascontrived to intend into the men of PassmoreWilliamson, was the trial of Thomas Y andothers charged with a plot is  the King,'the invention being,'  to General in his , 'that disease thousands of  under his ThomasY command to seize the Terms and theChief of London them to hall in,  to  the King and  wishresolution to give  and after that in  for a Commonwealth.' This is  theoriginal of the  basis of all the  as the head of the by  certain persons to knowledge of the  and their participation in it affair with which the public of that not very well . Judge Kane has notthought it necessary to not the United States alreadya good deal eat  the mentof the Fugitive Slave Act, in any such cary. His own imagination and thetestimony of Wheeler, to be  for nothing, he amply sufficient, and quite as good as that ofhalf a d purchased and pd deputy-marshals.                                               There is also a paint of comparison between therespective positions of Foster and Kane, which canhardly have escaped the keen, not to say greedyeye of our American Judge. Foster, at the timehe sat on the trial of Sir Henry Vane, was notyet Chief-Justice, had been appointed, either for theKing's Bench or the Common Pleas—the difficultybeing, as all the leading men of the bar wereCommonwealthmen, to find anybody who couldbe trusted by the Government to put into thoseplaces. After the display of superserviceable made by Sir Robert Foster is Vane's trial,be was at once appointed Chief-Justice. Shouldthe slave-driving Democrats remain in power,Judge Kane will have a claim to promotion quiteas strong, to say the least of it, as that of hisEnglish predecessor and exemplar.
