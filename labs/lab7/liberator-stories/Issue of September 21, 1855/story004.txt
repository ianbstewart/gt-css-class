 In a recent number of the Tribune, the editor remarksthat the annexation of Platte Coupty, Missouri,to Kansas Territory, is seriously contemplatedby the rascals calling themselves the KansasLegislature, at the same time expressing his approbationof the plan, and submitting his reasons as follows: Tribune He thinks that, should the scheme proposed beconsummated, then at least half of the so-calledLegislature of Kansas might become citizens ofthe Territory, for which they are now pretendingto legislate. And again—to use a celebrated Hibernicism—that Missouri' would gain a lose;' for,says the Tribune, there does not exist this side ofBotany Bay a territory of the same size, which enduresa greater number of lawless ruffians onits soil. Tribune In regard to this last declaration, we differwidely from the editor, and venture to assert thatthe sanctum of the Tribune contains a set of unprincipledrascals, whose daring and barefacedvillany is unequalled by the inhabitants of anyland, country, or nation. Tribune But as to the proposed annexation of PlatteCounty, we think it 'strange, passing strange,'that a measure of such vast importance to the interestsof our Territory should be canvassed bythe Abolition journals of New York, when such anidea had never presented itself to either the citizensof Kansas or Platte; and consequently mustconsider it an effort on the part of designing enemiesabroad to constitute that fertile, wealthy,populous and intelligent county a bone of contentionbetween Kansas and Missouri, in order tosever the bonds of sympathy, friendship and interest,now existing between them. Well do they know the consequences whichwould necessarily follow such a result. Kansas,deprived of the aid hitherto received from her Southernallies, would prove an easy prey to these rapaciousthieves of the North. If, however, the North flatterthemselves that this can ever be done, we mosthumbly beg leave to undeceive them. We can tellthe impertinent scoundrels of the Tribune, thatthey may exhaust an ocean of ink, their EmigrantAid Societies spend their millions and millions,their representatives in Congress spout their hereticaltheories till doomsday, and his ExcellencyFranklin Pierce appoint Abolitionist after Free-Soiloras Governor; yet we will continue to ter andfeather, drown, lynch and hng, every white-liveredAbolitionist who dares to pollute our soil.

Tribune yet we will continue to ter andfeather, drown, lynch and hng, every white-liveredAbolitionist who dares to pollute our soil.  And though our fair Territory may be refusedadmittance into the Union as a slaveholding Stateby the political demagogues of the North, we careas little for their decision as for the continued andfutile attacks which have been made upon ourrights by the indecisive Cabinet who now administerthe affairs of our nation. For we confidently hopethat the last national Congress may meet in Washingtonon the first Monday in December next; and we prophesywith the firm conviction that time will verify ourwords, that never again will the Southern Statesof the Republic suffer dictation at the hands of aset of negro-stealers and rescale who stand pledgedto war upon their rights until calculation censesto be a virtue. For we confidently hopethat the last national Congress may meet in Washingtonon the first Monday in December next We ask the slaveholding community what objectthey had in view when, as free, independent andsovereign States, they  themselvestogether under the Federal! Constitution! Was itnot for the purpose of securing sympathy and assistancefrom each and all, while they themselvesshould be protected from aggression on the part offriends or lees at home or abroad; at the sametime preserving their identity as sovereign and independentmembers of the confederation? as free, independent sovereign  sovereign independent Now if this Federal compact should at any timeprove insufficient for pretension, and a portion ofthe States should seek for their own aggrandizementto force or impose  upon the remainder,in direct opposition for their interests andwishes; what interests have those whose rightsare trampled on in the further observance of acompact which daily lessons their strength, andserves to strip them of their new remaining means ofdefence?  For what are laws enacted; if not for the protectionof person and property! This same Constitutionrecognizes our slaves as property and ifit is to be observed by its must protect the rights ofthe slaveholder is whatever por of the Union bemay be. But when  Massachusetts or Ohio,  and refuses to  the rights of our citizens, not the States  thereby from their  as if it mere civil contract between individuals?  But when  Massachusetts or Ohio,  and refuses to  the rights of our citizens, not the States  thereby from their  as if it mere civil contract between individuals?           If this be true—and we realy think it can bedenied even by the most prejudiced—then has theSouth had sufficient  on ry months for the past ten years. Her blenight to do so, individually or sly, wedo not intend to argue, for we consider it as aclear mathematical axiom which none but fools andfanatics will attempt to dispute. If the SouthernStates have it not, what claim have they totheir proud and bounced right of independence andsovereignty!  sufficient  on ry months for the past ten years.      If it be not guaranteed by the Constitution,then they possess it by right of revolution, andlet 'the right makes the might' be their motto.
