 ☞'for SLAVES—for articles of merchandise, underthe name of persons.....in fact, the oppressor representingthe oppressed!...To call government thus constituteda democracy, is to insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slavery. Its reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of the nation is to establish an artificialmajority in the slave representation over that of thefree people, in the American Congress; AND THEREBYTO MAKE THE PRESERVATION, PROPAGATION AND PERPETUATIONOF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANIMATION SPIRITOF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.'—John Quincy Adams.
