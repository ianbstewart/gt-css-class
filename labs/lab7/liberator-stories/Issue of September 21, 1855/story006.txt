 The article from the South Carolina Times willhe found in another column. It is a curiosity inits way. One in  upon it, muchas we would upon a  from ,as the Jungles of  are evidentlyout of their  in those civilized partsof the world. The follow  to have heard ofthe Bible, but it is evidently only a  ofits  which it as a code of  buildingthe wives and priest has been with the  itis too bad to play of such clerical  uponthese . Wehope mark the text which reads,—'The spirit  theLord is upon me, to preach good  the. He bath  to bind up the hearted, to proclaim liberty to the  andthe opening of the prisons to them the  bound.'Of course, after receiving that he will  SouthCarolina to burn the Bible as an onablepublication. The poor fellow  to havemade a similar mistake about religion. He evidentlysupposes the whole thing to be a place ofclap-trap, by which Northern men are to be inducedto catch Jerrys, and send them back to theSouth. Up here, where the Gospel is preached,men have learned, long ago, that religion is notmainly significant an obligation to return tobondage those who escape. The rescues of Jerrywas one pf the  acts of worship towarda God of humanity, that has stirred the people'sheart in an age. And we desire to 'comfort andedify' our South Carolina thren by the assurance,that that type of religion is reviving gloriouslyall over the North. Dough-faces, both inreligion and politics, are crowding their way tothe 'anxious coat,' and man of the New YorkSafety Committee are under 'deep conviction,' andready to ask for Abolition prayers. How wide isthe contrast between a Heathen and Christian religion!Are not our Missionary Boards neglectingthe city of Columbia, South Carolina, and especiallythe editor of the Times! South Carolina Times                             Times! But the editor has mistaken the facts. His accountof the rescue is, that some Northern Judgelet Jerry go free, and the people now get togetherto celebrate the event. Startling as may be theannouncement to him, we desire to let all the peopleof the Palmetto land know, that it was aHigher Court than that of any single Judge thatset Jerry free. It was the PEOPLE. They did notwait for Judge or Jury. The nature in the greatCourt of Humanity, up here in Central New York,have prejudged the case of every man who is soughtto be enslaved, and decided that he shall go free.The case is far better to the cause of freedom, andfar more aggravating to the growling, fanglessdespotism of this South Carolina blood-hound,than he dreamed of. We have a way in gettingup extempore courts, in which to  all eachcases in this region, which do summary justice toall kidnappers who come this way. EOPLE. prejudged  The Times seems utterly oblivious to the differencebetween helping an innocent fugitive frompiratical bondage, to self-possession and freedom,and Gunpowder plot, or the murderous mereof French Protestants on the eve of St. mew.To reason with a madman, who cannot tellthe difference between murdering thousands incold blood, and freeing a poor innocent victim ofinhuman slavery, is a folly into which we shallnot fall. Moral distinctions are impossible withsuch a poor fellow. If he would come North, andlet his moral nature grow for a few years, hemight discover the difference between a liberatorof brutally enslaved innocence, and the cold-bloodedmurderer of a British Parliament. But wemust wait for the fruits of Missionary work uponhis benighted mind. His reference to John A.Murrell is equally unfortunate. Murrell stole negroesfrom their man-stealing processors, and soldthem again to other man-stealers in the South, forgain. Jerry was rescued from the man-thief Sear,who, like the editor of the Times and all otherSouth Carolina slaveholders, only had a robber'sright to him, and returned to himself, his only properowner. When the editor of the Times growsto where he can understand the difference betweenstealing a man from a robber to sell him to anotherrobber, and rescuing him from a robber to restorehim to liberty, he will understand the differencebetween the deeds of Murrell and the heroeswho liberated Jerry by scattering Court and kidnapperslike chaff before the wind. Times   Times himself Times But we referred to matters mainly for the purposeof saving a word about that old threat of theSouthern Shrew, to dissolve the Union. It canhave no terror for the North, but, looked uponmerely as a question of political expediency, mustever he desirable to this portion of the Confederacy.Were the North free from the South to-day,she would right up and move onward before thebreeze of civil prosperity, like a vessel lightenedof her load. Then, while the South was footingher own bills for Seminole ware and Mexican conquests,the North would be filling her coiffure inpeace. To govern the South, and take care ofSouthern interests, has cost the North millions ofdollars, for which she has received only now demandsupon her treasures and arms. These poor,miserable political fire-eaters, who talk of dissolvingthe Union, sustain much the same relation tothe Union as do the people of our County Henceto the County Government. We have met theirpostage bills even the cost of their Florida slavehunts, and similar forays upon freedom. And nowif we will not hunt negroes who escape by hundreds,in spite of all the vigilance and wisdom oftheir woman-hunting statesmanship, why, theythrew off their woman—no, the  they stole fromthe earnings of their unpaid laborers—and poll uptheir sleeves, and swear they will dissolve theUnion!  The impudent bluster-of the thing is unbearable,and the vociferous brawlers dare not do anythingof the kind. Why has not some man inCongress said to these follows,—'Dissolve away!Who cares?' They are like young Tom Noodle,who attempts to make his sister Nancy believe,that if she don't give him a big piece of goodcake, he will pull out his own hair, bite his ownnose, and knock out his own beajus. And ourNorthern slaver Nancy has, by the help of some ofour political grand of the male gender,been made to  that the desperate hey mightdo something ',' if unspecified. The Bwould beg on s to be allowed to remain inthe Union to-day, if she thought the North wasearnestly intent upon dissolution. South Carolinacould hardly be kicked out of the Union.
