 A large portion of the Press—including most ofthe Loco-Foco, and nearly all of the self-styled to independentjournals—maintain a studied and born silence respecting the resolve of the U.S.House of Representatives of the last, night of theSession appended to the Executive bill, puttingTwo Millions of Dollars into the hands of the President,to be used by him as he thinks fit in procuringPeace with Mexico. That resolve, it will be remembered,is in the words following:  'Provided, that is an express and fundamentalconditions to the acquisition of any territory from theRepublic of Mexico by the United States, by virtuesof any Treaty which may be negotiated between themand to the use by the Executive of the moneys hereis appropriated, neither  or implementer servitudesshall  except in a my part of paid territory, exceptfor , where of the party shall first be dulyconvicted.' neither  or implementer servitudesshall  except in a my part of paid territory    This was adopted (83 to 61) by the all but unanimousvote of the Representatives of Free States—the Nays from the Free States, six in all, bringWork and P of Ind., ,of Illinois, and Chapman of Michigan. Theauthors of the bill now turned against it, and triedto lay it on the table, or do anything to defeat it,and Gen. McKay himself, who had reported it, nowdid everything in the power to struggle it. All was,however unavailing. Work and P    Chapman The most intense excitement was created in theHouses by this proposition. It was more by Mr.WILMOT of Pennsylvania, who is not only a Loco-Foco, but the only Free Trader from that State.Among its most energetic supporters were HANISALHAMLIN of , and JOHN WENTWORTH ofIllinois, who had hitherto been among the man obsequiousin their ordinance to the ultra-spirit. TIMOTHY JEFFINS of this State was amongits earliest and most energetic supported, and ourwhole Loco-Foco Delegation ultimately came upto the work. There were a few Northern slaverymenwho resumes to vote at all, but the great manstand square up, and revised every attempt to whirkas well as to defeat Mr. Wili preposition. ANISAL AMLIN  OHN ENTWORTH  IMOTHY EFFINS  That large portion of the Southern Leo-Focoswho have been accustomed to carry election afterelection on a mere exhibition of the Free StateWhigs on essentially hostile to slavery and theirLoco-Foco brethren in these States, as 'the naturalallies of the South,' were pale with excitement, angerand conservation. Mutterings and undertonesof alarm and excitement ran though the House.'There,' said an eminent Carolinian, 'We have beentalking of Abolition for years, and here it is at but! every effort to  or inti Northern Loco-F back into the wanted  signallyFailed. A spirit had been evoked by the MexicanWar, the overthrew of the Tariff, Vote of theHarbor bill, &c., which would not down at anyman's bidding. Even if the mediated  of therejection of this proviso or the defeat of the Generalappropriation bill had been made, it wouldhave been fearlessly and fully .        That the So there section of the dominant party— the Administration man particularly—determinedthat the bill should not at any rate become alaw, except on the unattainable condition of the strikingout of this proviso, is most certain. There wasnot a chance for its passage except by a union ofall the Free State and all the Whig Senators inits favor, and a universal agreement to large debateupon it. But all this was promoted by H. Law's of the Ala, who  the striking outof Mr. Wh's provi. Of course this sustainwas made with the clearest understanding whether maful or not, its result would be itsdefeat of the bill. Mr. Davis read to oppose it, anduptake some (manly  (not longer.) promisingto give way its  for a station to continue thesession nine hours longer. But the Hones cookwas ahead of that of the Senate, and the Hi adjourned,while Mr. D. guided by the Senate clock,supported there were will some minutes of the Sessionright timing. So the bill tell dead, as McKay &Co. had roted, and as Lewis intended, but as Mr.Davis did not intend. He only wished to have theProviso, and secure the  as it  from the. Yet he is sustained by the Loco-Foco andsham-mental Press as the deliberate ever ofthe bill, while McKay, walker and Co., are notblamed in the least!
