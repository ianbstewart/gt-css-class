I now come to before you the duties you owe to your masters andmistresses here upon earth.

And p do notthink that I want to deceive you, when I tell youthat your masters and mistresses are God's and that if you are faulty towards them.

There arise several otherrules of fully towards your masters and mistresses,which I shall endeavor to lay out in order beforeyou. And in the first place, you are to be obedient andsubject to your masters in all things. * * AndChristian ministers are commanded to 'exhort servantsto be obedient unto their own masters, and toplease them well in ail things, not answering themagain, or gainsaying.' You see how strictly God requirethis you, that whatever your masters andmistresses order you to do, you must net about itimmediately, and faithfully perform it, without anydisputing of grumbling, and take care to pleasethem well in all things. And for your encouragementhe tells you that he will reward yon for it inheaven : because while you are honestly and faithfullydoing your masters business here, you are servingyour Lord and Master in heaven. You see, also,that you are not to take any exceptions to the behaviorof your masters and mistresses, and that you areto be subject and obedient, not only to such as aregood, and gentle. and mild towards you, but also tosuch as may be fro ward, peevish, and hard. For youare not at liberty to choose your own masters, butinto whatever hands God hath been pleased to putyou, you must do your duty, and God will rewardyou for it.' obedient subject servingyour Lord and Master in heaven. That is, the slaves 'serve God by serving theirmasters, and if they are remiss so in their service towardstheir masters, they sin against God's commands,and He will punish them everlastingly thereforeunless they repent and do otherwise ! God masters masters God's punish them everlastingly And again on page 116: 'All things whatsoever ye should that men shoulddo unto you, do you even so unto them; that is, do byall mankind just as you would desire they should do byby you, it you were in their place and they in yours. 'All things whatsoever ye should that men shoulddo unto you, do you even so unto them Now to suit this rule to your particular circumstances;suppose you were masters and mistressesand had servants under you, would you not desirethat your servants should do their business faithfullyand heartily, as well when your back was turnedas while you were looking over them? — would younot expect that they should take notice of what yousaid to them? That they should behave themselveswith respect towards you and yours, and be as carefulof everything belonging to you as you would beyourselves? You are servants, do therefore, as youwould wish to be done by, and you will be both goodservants to your masters, and good servants to God,who requires this of you, and will reward you wellfor it, it you do it for the sake of conscience, in obedienceto his commands.' faithfully heartily your masters God,who requires this of you I never saw but one other argument which approachedthis of Bishop Meade, and that in Rev.

But I imagine that I hear some one saying—it isimpossible that in North Carolina a female slave canbe thus subject to the will of her master. Let us seewhat the Supreme Court of that State says. In thesame of 'the State vs. Mann, Dev. Rep. p. ,() the Deft.

With slavery it is far otherwise. The end is theprofit of the master, his security and the publicpeace. The subject is one doomed in his own personand in his prosperity, to live without knowledge, andwithout capacity to make anything his own, and to soilthat others may reap the fruits. The end is theprofit of the master subject own personand in his prosperity, to live without knowledge, andwithout capacity to make anything his own, and to soilthat others may reap the fruits. ' What moral consideration shall be addressed tosuch a being, to convince him, what it is impossiblebut that the most stupid most feel and know cansever be true, that he is thus to labour upon a principleof natural duty, or for the sake of his own personalhappiness? Such services can only be expertedfrom one who has no will of his own, who surrendershis will in explicit obedience to that ofanother. Such obedience is the consequence onlyof uncontrolled authority over the body. There isnothing else which can operate to produce the effect.The power of the master must be absolute torender the submission of the  perfect.
