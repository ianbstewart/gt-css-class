 The Union thus announces the failure of the'last card' of the Session: The Union 'The important bill which authorizes the Presidentto employ $2,000,000 in facilitating the settlementof pence with Mexico, was actually lost byMr. Senator Davis of Massachusetts speaking againsttime, whole voice from the chamber were heard remainingagainst him for his determined attemptto prevent the introduction of a resolution prolongingthe solution for a few hours. This measure whichis deemed most important for negotiating peace betweenthe two countries, and the fundamental principleof which was recognized by the vote of thehouse of Representatives on the passage of the bill,and by a decided vote of the Senate on their own resolutions,was sacrificed by a Senator's  thetime at the  until the moment of adjournmenthad arrived.   Whatever  may arise from the  of thisbill, may by fairly attributable to the 'honorable'senator from Massachusetts.'   This  attack on one of the ables and no of American Senators impels no so call attentionto the following facts:   1. It is a fact that Mr. Polk determined to opennegotiations with Mexico, and actually did dispatchhis secret agent to communicate with the government ofthat country several days before be sent his Mergto the Senate making this appropriation of $2,000,000to be used by him in making Peace with Mexico.it is thus rendered certain that the attempt to makea Peace is in to no se dependent out the success ofthis application for $ 2,000,000. actually did dispatchhis secret agent to communicate with the government ofthat country several days before  this appropriation of $2,000,000to be used by him in making Peace with Mexico.  2. One of two things most he true. Either Polkdid not, when he dispatched his agent, think hewould want any much money to be named in makingpeace, of the purposely delayed his application tocongress until the last hours of the Session, in thehope of struggling it through without inquire ordiscussion. In either case the  for thisman cannot possibly , and Congress isto meet again with us four months. If Bribery isthe game to be played, cash in ha is always betterthan pro but if the money is to be usedin as  legi way, surely Mexico cantrust the faith of our Government for a term of twoor three months from the signing of the Tru.        3. The bill giving Mr. Poul this $2,000,000, tobe used at his and withoutany know  to Congress of the bowor where was reported to the  by GMcKay from the Committee of ways and .       The He amended it by appending the followingProviso:  'Provided, That, as an express and fundamentalcondition to the equalization of any territory fromthe Republic of Mexican by the United States by virtueof any Treaty which may be neglected betweenthem, and to the use by the Executive of moneysbare in appropriated, neither Slavery or involuntaryservants shall  in any part of aid territoryexcept for , whereas the party shall fast beduly convicted. neither Slavery or involuntaryservants shall  in any part of aid territory   This amended, the bill passed by a decider of the Whigs appearing is, but Gen.

The bill having thus passed the House, and  excitement, that truly adjourned (Saturdaynight; and on Sunday night the Joint Committeesof Conference on the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriationbill, composed of  L-Poems andtwo Whigs for of the six from Salve les, wascalled together, and a resolute attempt  tojoint Mr. Polk's 2,000,000, which the House hadjust  in a separate hill, into the General Appropriationbill, so that it should either be for and throw atleast the debts Anti-Slavery press, or the Generalappropriate on bill fail, and the government byrun high and dry ashore! But when a  ofthis maneuver get wind, and intense excitementamong the Members generally from the From was created and a determination quickly arrivedat to kill the Appropriation bill, and all consequencesrather than have the trick succeed. Soit had to be given up.     for    so that it should either be for and throw atleast the debts Anti-Slavery press, or the Generalappropriate on bill fail, and the government byrun high and dry ashore!    5. The bill went to the Senate on Monday, andcame up a little before the time previously agreedas for adjournment. It was known that those whocall themselves 'the Sixth,' and as such make everythingbond to the extension and fortification ofSlavery, (through we do not believe the real sentimentseven of the South  with theirs.) hadresolved that the provide publishing Slavery in anyMexican territory which may be  in our Trlyof Peace should be stricken and or the bill should bekilled. The Slave States, including Texas, havea majority in the Senate, and can do as they pleasethere; and it was educated that times SouthernSenators who do not device the extension of Slavery,would not date to vote us they felt on as issueon made up between Freedom and Slavery.Mr. Davis of Miss. Row to debate the nation tostrike out the proviso, who did delete it (being everymoment interrupted by bills from the Human &&c.) until the Seion died a natural death. He haddetermined, since it appeared settled that the billmust he lost either with or without the proviso, thatit should die with it, on that the moral effect ofthe vote of the House should not be neutralized bya contrary vote of the Saints. He only erred inhis estimate of the course of the Senate. Had thevote been taken, the proviso would have been SUSTAINEDin the Senate, and Lewis &Co. would havebeen compelled to talk on the S, as they hadresistant that the bill  not  with the antislaveryproviso attached to it. It was simply aquestion of how the bill was to be killed as it wasdoomed any how.  resolved that the provide publishing Slavery in anyMexican territory which may be  in our Trlyof Peace should be stricken and or the bill should bekilled.    the proviso would have been SUSTAINEDin the Senate    Such are the  in the case. How do they correspondwith the Union's charges on Senator Davis?who could imagine that the Virginia andother Southern Leo-Focus had inanimately vote. Iagainst the bill which Mr. Davis is assailed bythe Union for destroying?  By the way, the Evening Feel's correspondentsays of this very bill and failure; Evening Feel's To be candid, I am very glad that the whole prepositionwas defected. Of course, it is painful to meto express doubt or dissatisfaction with any recommendationof the President, but this two million businesscame in 'such a questionable ships,' that reallyI could not reconciled it with my sense of duty togive it may support.'
