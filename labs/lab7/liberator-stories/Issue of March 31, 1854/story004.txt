 TO THE EDITOR OF THE LIBERATOR: O DITOR IBERATOR SIR—Much has been said and written, of late, both inand out of Congress, on the subject of Compromise.Compromise, Compromise, COMPROMISE, seems to bethe order of the day. First, we have an appeal ofmembers of Congress to the people of the U. States, withthis inquiry: 'Shall slavery be permitted in Nebraska?'We ran our eye over the appeal, and read as follows:'At the present session' of Congress, 'a newNebraska bill is reported by the Senate Committee onTerritories, which, should it unhappily receive thesanction, or Congress, will open all the unorganized territoryof the Union to the ingress of slavery.' The appealcontinues: 'We arraign this bill as a gross violationof a sacred pledge, as a criminal betrayal of preciousrights,' &c. Farther on, among the reasons givenfor this arraignment, we find that, at a certain sessionof Congress, a violent controversy was at length terminatedby a compromise. 'Missouri' was allowed tocome into the Union with slavery, but a section was insertedin the aot authorizing her admission, excludingslavery, forever, from all the territory acquired fromFrance not included in the new State, lying north of 86deg. 30 min. Several paragraphs follow, in which itis attempted to show that this Compromise was a sacredinspect, which was to be held inviolate through all comingtime, which 'compact' would be grossly violated bythe passage of the aforesaid Nebraka Bill. A littlefurther on, we find Compromise again. 'There acquisitionsof territory have been made by treaty.' 'Thethird was from Mexico.' 'The controversy which arosefrom this acquisition is fresh in the remembrance of theAmerican people. Out of it sprung the acts of Congress,commonly known as the Compromise measures of1850, by one of which California was admitted as aFree State, while two others, organizing the Territoriesof New Mexico and Utah, exposed all the residue of therecently acquired territory to the invasion of slavery.'Further, we are told that 'These acts were never supposedto abrogate or touch the existing exclusion of slaveryfrom what is now called Nebraska. They appliedto the territory acquired from Mexico, and to that only.They were intended as a settlement of the controvercygrowing out of that acquisition, and of that controversyonly. They must stand or fall by their own merits.'Then pretty high authority is quested to show that 'itis evident the Missouri Compromise cannot be repealed,'&c. Arguments are then brought to show that'the pretenous' that 'the Territory, covered by thepositive prohibition of 1820,  a similar relationto slavery with that required by Mexico,  by prohibition except that of disputed constitutional orMexican law, and that the Compromises of 1850 requirethe incorporation of the pro-slavery clauses of the Utahand New Mexico bill in the Nebraska Act, are mere inventions,designed to cover up from public reprchensionmeditated bad faith.' Further, 'were he now living,no one would be more forward, or more eloquent, ormore indignant in his denunciation of that bad faith,than Henry Clay, the foremost champion of both compromises.'Our attention is then directed to 'some ofthe more immediate and inevitable consequences of thismeasure.' Then comes the following appeal to thepeople: 'We warn you that the dearest interests ofFreedom and the Union are in imminent peril. Serviledemagogues may tell you that the Union can be maintainedonly by submitting to the demands of slavery.We tell you that the safety of the Union can only beinsured by the full recognition of the just claims ofFreedom and Man. The Union was formed to establishjustice, and secure the blensigns of liberty. When itfails to accomplish these ends, it will be worthless, andwhen it becomes thless, it cannot long endure,' &c.,closing with the following: 'We will not despair: forthe cause of human freedom is the cause of God.'  IR Compromise, Compromise OMPROMISE compromise.   Compromise again.          On the other hand, we have a speech from a notedmember of Congress, himself chairman of the Committeereporting the Nebraska Bill, in which we find the following:'They,' that is, the Committee, 'had takenthe principles of the Compromise acts of 1850 for theirguide, and had made each and every provision of thisbill accord with those principles. These principles werebased upon, and recognized to its fullest extent, thegreat right of the people to self-government, and leavingthe people of the Territories the privilege of governingthemselves, free of all control, except by the Constitutionof the United States, and limited and restrictedupon no particular subject by their position northor south of any arbitrary geographical line. The recentbill reported by the Committee had for its object tomake that plain which, in the first one, seemed to be indoubt or uncertainty. In some places, the first bill wasunderstood as repealing the Missouri Compromise, andin some others, as not doing so. As this bill was intendedby the Committee as carrying out fully the principlesof the Compromise of 1850, and as they consideredthat Compromise had superseded the MissouriCompromise, that fact had better be plainly and distinctlystated.' Farther along in his speech, the Senatorbrings forward what, I suppose, he considers thereasons on which the opinion of the above Committee,that the Compromise Acts of 1850 forever annulled andsuperseded the Missouri Compromise of 1820, was based,and by which he attempts to show that the statementscontained in the fore mentioned 'Appeal to the peopleof the United States,' charging certain individuals ordocuments with 'violating sacred pledges, betraying preciousrights, meditating bad faith,' &c. &c., 'are false,'and that the 'violation of the solemn compact,' 'badfaith,' &c., are chargeable to another, and quite differentset, of individuals, or documents. He says, 'TheCompromise of 1850 established the principle of Congressionalnon-intervention, and set aside the geographicalline as no longer practicable, because it had beenimpossible to maintain it'; that 'the New Mexico TerritorialAct provides that the local Legislature of theTerritory shall have full power to legislate on all rightfulsubjects, with no restriction whatever, except thatimposed by the Constitution of the United States.'   'Here the local Legislature is invested with full powerto legislate upon all subjects, including slavery. Afterhaving spent considerable time in attempting to showthat the Compromise Acts of 1850 had swept the Compromiseline of 1820 clean by the beard, the Senatesay—'The Compromise of 1850 was no temporarymeasure. It was intended to be a final settlement ofthe slavery question, upon the great principle of theright of self-government by the people;' that it was sounderstood by both 'the Democratic and Whig parties.'The Senator 'contended that the settlement effected bythe establishment of the Utah and New Mexico Territoriesupon the principle of allowing the people to act forthemselves, and guaranteeing their admission with orwithout slavery, as they themselves should determine,was a total abandonment of all former rules and compromiseson the subject. The principle then adoptedwas intended to apply not only to the other territorythen owned by the United States, but also to all whichmight thereafter be acquired. If it were otherwise, thesettlement of 1850 amounted to nothing, for the wholequestion would be opened every time a territorial governmentwas to be formed, or territory acquired.' 'Heappealed to those who represented the North, to standby this principle of self-government, which would alwayslead men and States to do all things best lated to promote their own interest,' &c.    I have, Sir, been thus explicit and lengthy in quotingfrom there two documents, in order to come at the realdifficulties that lie in the way of a just and final settlementof this grant question, by directing attention tothe first, or procuring, cause of all those Compromisetroubles which are continually occurring in the Governmentof the United States. The procuring cause of allthese Compromise troubles and difficulties is found inthe fact, that the Constitution of the United States is,itself, a Compromise. Two syn tens were incorporatedto form that instrument, namely, Liberty and Slavery:Liberty for the Whites, and Slavery for the Blacks.The Constitution of the United States as really containsa system of Slavery for the blacks, so long as the whitepeople of any of the United States shall require it, asit does of Liberty for the whites. And this system wasput into that instrument by Compromise. Had theConstitution of the Untied States been formed on theprinciple of equal rights for all living under it, therewould have been no comprise of principle in its formation,and no need of any compromise after. But itwas not. In this formation of that instrument, the principleof equal rights for all was not recognized. Thatprinciple was sacrificed on the altar of political expediency,and, by Compromise, the foul system of chattelslavery was allowed to rear its bra form, and bescented side by side with Liberty in the same government,and that government claiming to be the mostperfect government of any on earth: and there thatsystem has remained, for more than sixty years, withheart of stone and brow of brass, with its foot upon theneeds of millions of  beings, rearing its form to heaven, and deifying the a of the livingGod! Hence the absolute necessity of CompressionCo is order to  both systemsalive. First, by Compresive. permit the finalmonster Slavery to enter a government about to beformed, profinsedly, for freedom! Secondly, by Compromise,divide the spoils with him by geographical lines!Thirdly, by Compromise, annihilate those geographicallines, throw open the whole ungoverned territory of theUnited States to the unrestricted march of his unhallowedfost, and allow him to drive, rough shed, withhis chariots of iron, over every fact of that vast territory,thought to be concerted to Freedom and toGod !! All this comes of Compremise! it is the legitimatefruit of the original tree; and it comes withthat uneering certainty which is the inevitable result ofthose eternal laws existing between cause and effect.In thefirst Compromise, the principles of eternal justiceand right were sacrificed to make room for theSlave Power, in the formation of the United StatesGovernment; so, by the last Compromise, these principlesmust be sacrificed, throughout all the unorganizedterritory of the United States, in order to give Slaveryan equal footing with Liberty, whenever that territoryshall come into the Union, as States. In the first Compromise,the principles of eternal right and justice werescarified, in order to effect a Union between Slaveryand Liberty; so, in the last Compromise, the sameprinciples must be sacrificed, in order to keep thatUnion in existence. But the Compromise of 1850,we are old, was intended to be a final settlement ofthe Slavery question upon the great principle of theright of self-government by the people, which wouldlead men and States to do all things best calculated topromote their own interest. Indeed! What kind of aprinciple of self-government is that, which takes thegovernment of moral and intellectual beings out of thehand of God, and undertakes, itself, to make laws fortheir management;—that strikes down man, created inthe image of h Maker, and stamped with the breadseal of the Divite Original, and herds him togetherpromiscuously, with the brute, by law; for the purposeof promoting its own its own interests?  cause     Co       It is, Sir, the principle of chattel slavery, itself aconstituent and organic part of the Constitution of theUnited States; it is the principle of chattel slavery,itself a component and very prominent part of theAmerican Union; and one of the principles on whichthat Union was based and now stand. Yes, Sir, thefoundation of the American Union was laid in blood;and to this hour is supported by the bones and sinewsof millions of human beings. The American Union wasformed by a Compromise between Liberty and Slavery,and its peace and safety, we are told, depend on thestrict observance and carrying out of the principles ofthe Compromise measures of 1850; otherwise, the wholequestion of slavery will be opened every time a territorialgovernment is to be formed, or territory acquired.   On the other hand, in view of an attempt to carryout the Compromise measures of 1850,  are told thedearest interests of Freedom and the Union are in imminentperil. Now, the dearest interests of Freedomare not in peril, but we are about to be finally establishedon the eternal principles of self-evident Truth. But,the American Union is in imminent peril, for it is aboutto be overthrown forever. Further; servile demagoguesmay tell you that the Union can be maintained onlyby submitting to the demands of slavery. But, thedays of slavery are umbered; the slave is a man; Godis on his side, and the American Union is about to bedestroyed, to give him the opportunity of asserting hisrights. Again: we tell you that the safety of the Unioncan only be insured by the full recognition of the justclaims of Freedom and of Man. But this is the reasonwhy the American Union is to be destroyed, namely,that those rights may be recognized. Further we aretold, that the American Union was formed to establishjustice, and secure the blessings of liberty. Now, theUnion was not formed to establish justice for and securethe blessings of liberty to, the black man; for, inthat event, every slave on the American seil wouldhave been liberated from his chains. There would havebeen no Compromise with slavery in the formation ofthe government—no Missouri Compromise in 1820—noCompromise measures in 1850. The Union was formedto establish justice and secure the blessings of liberty?For and to whom? For the whites. But the Unionwas formed to establish slavery for the blacks, and securethe slaveholder the privilon of continuing his ungedlytraffic in slaves and the souls of men, as really asit was to establish justice and secure the blessings ofliberty for the whites, and no one clause of the Constitutionof the United States can possibly be applied toa slave, to establish justice for him, or to secure to himthe blessings of liberty. It is of no use whatever toquarrel about recent Compromises; to dispute theground with the Slave Power of this nation as to whichparty is entitled to the larger share of the spoils. Thefact is, every thing was lost at the beginning; the firstCompromise is the only one that the true friends of Godand man have anything to do with. I reiterate, formore than sixty years the grant monster, Chattel Slavery,has had full away in the United States Government.There he stands, in full proportions, with formerect, and brow of Abrams; there, in the Constitution ofthe United States, stands the uncircumcised Philistine,with his foot firmly planted on those natural and inalienablerights of millions of moral and intellectual beingswith which they were endowed by their Crater,with his eye upturned toward Heaves, proudly defyingthe armies of the living God. He that would combatwith him successfully, must attack him in his strongheld, not with carnal weapons, but in the name andstrength of the Lord of H. The cause of humanfreedom is the cause of God; therefore, more are theythat be with us than they that be with them.       W.S.F. ☞ In a speech, delivered by Senate  of SouthCarmelina, on the Nebraska Bill, Feb. 24th, coure thefollowing passage:—'It has become extremely popularto bestew praises upon my gallant countryman, CaptainIngraham. Sir, he deserves them; he is a ;I know him well'—&c.       The thought that suggests itself in this connection,is, whether it is worth while for an elitionsit, whetherin or out of Congress, to be enthusiastic for giving sucha man gold medals, before he fully appreciates the of Whittier, which could be made use of by anAustrian:—  elitionsit  appreciates  could  'Go,  your  slaves at home.Then cause and ask the like of us'    GEO W.
