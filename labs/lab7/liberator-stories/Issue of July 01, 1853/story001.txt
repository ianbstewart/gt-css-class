 THE U.S. CONSTITUTION 'A COVENANT WITH DEATHAND AN AGREEMENT WITH HELL ☞'Yes!' IT CANNOT BE DENIED—the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of theirconsent to the Constitution, three special provisions TOSECURE THE PERPETUITY OF THEIR DOMINION OVER THEIRSLAVES. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African slave trade; the second wasTHE STIPULATION TO SURRENDER FUGITIVE SLAVES—anengagement positively prohibited by the laws of God,delivered from Sinai; and thirdly, the exaction fatalto the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor SLAVES—for articles of merchandize, underthe name of persons ..... in fact, the oppressor representing the oppressed!... To call government thus constituteda democracy, is to insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slavery. The reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of the nation is, to establish an artificialmajority in the slave representation over that of thefree people, in the American Congress, AND THEREBYTO MAKE THE PRESERVATION, PROPOGATION AND PERPETUATIONOF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANIMATING SPIRITOF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.'—John Quincy Adams.
