 RUNAWAY KILLED. On Saturday last, a runawaynegro was killed in the parish of East Baton Rouge,La., under the following circumstances: UNAWAY ILLED. Two citizens of Port Hudson, learning that anegro was at work on a flat-boat loading with sandjust below that place, who was suspected of beinga runaway, went down in a skiff for the purpose ofarresting him. Having seized him and put him inthe skiff, they started back, but had not proceededfar when the negro, who was at the oars, seized ahatchet and assaulted one of them, wounding himvery seriously. A scuffle ensued, during which bothparties fell overboard. They were both rescued bythe citizens pulling to them with a skiff. Findinghim so unmanageable, the negro was put ashore,and the parties returned to Port Hudson for armsand a pack of negro dogs, and started again withthe intention to capture him. They soon got on his trail, and when found again,he was standing at bay upon the outer edge of alarge raft of drift-wood, armed with a club andpistol. In this position, he bade defiance to men anddogs, knocking the latter into the water with hisclub, and threatening death to any man whoapproached him. Finding him obstinately determinednot to surrender, one of his pursuers shothim. He fell at the third fire, and so determinedwas he not to be captured, that, when an effort wasmade to rescue him from drowning, he made battlewith his club, and sunk waving his weapon inangry defiance at his pursuers. He refused togive the name of his owner.—Feliciana Whig. Feliciana Whig. ☞This case of desperate heroism on the one hand,and of diabolical cruelty on the other, is circulatingthrough the American journals without note or comment—as an item of intelligence merely, instead of its beinga transaction that should cause the earth to shudder,and fill with horror every humane breast. Yet it wasa lawful deed in a professedly Christian land!
