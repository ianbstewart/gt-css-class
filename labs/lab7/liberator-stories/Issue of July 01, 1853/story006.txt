 HORACK MANN has concluded his defence of hisposition as a voter and office-holder under the Constitution,in two letters, each filling nearly a pagein the Liberator. We see nothing in his argumentwhich we have not many times encountered in otherforms and from other pens. We regret that he hadnot offered it, in its proper time, when Mr. Phillipsso frequently and ineffectually invited him to giveit; though the personal rudeness and abusivenesswhich justified Mr. P's withdrawal from the controversymay have saved this fine word-castle froman examination, under which it would dissolve likefrost-work under sun-light. The Liberator hasshown a liberality in giving Mr. Mann, underthe circumstances, so large a space in its columns,which we shall gladly see reciprocated by the FreeSoil papers.â€”Pennsylvania Freeman.
