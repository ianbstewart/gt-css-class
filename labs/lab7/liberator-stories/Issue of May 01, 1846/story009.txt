 (From our London Correspondent.) From our London Correspondent. LONDON, 137 Cheapside. DEAR SIR: EAR IR This day, March 3, we have just received a packet, which conveys to this country the news that thePresident of the United States has declined to referthe Oregon question, and the aspect as between thetwo countries looks more warlike in consequence.All friends of peace here,—and they are a verylarge majority,—regret this very much; for we hadhoped that the news—the good news to the world,we think it—that our minister had determined uponrepealing the Corn Laws, and reducing the customsduties so greatly would have produced a very oppositeresult in America. It is probable, however, that this movement onthe part of President Polk, is the result of viewsformed, when other dispositions on the part of theEnglish Government were prevalent. If the people in Great Britain had the Power ofchoosing their own members of Parliament, (seveneighthsare without the suffrage,) there would be noWar, for the supplies would not be voted. The American people will yet see the folly, asthe English people do see, not only the folly, butthe wickedness of war, upon such a question especially. I speak of the people as distinct from theirgovernments. As it regards this country and its interests, itwould be an object-less war; it would be a totalwaste of life and treasure, for a purpose useless itrealized. Colonization has been a burden to the EnglishPeople. Colonies are used by our aristocracy almeans of patronage, and have invariably cost ismore than they have benefited us as a nation. Colonies are of no value, except as customers. Nations, separated by natural boundaries, are only ifvalue to each other , in proportion as they supplythe wants of the other. It is in exchanging theirlabor and property,—that is to any,by commerce,—that they benefit each other; but we have never soused colonies. We treat them as dependants, prehibittheir commerce with other nations, insist upontheir quarrelling when we quarrel; and by thispreventing their commercial growth, make themdependant upon us. Dependance is always costlyto the protector. By forcing them into our wars,we make them participant of the losses and miserieswhich war necessarily involves, and give toourselves a larger surface to protect. They offerto our enemies salient points of attack and destruction, which the protector must assist to restore.This to us a numerically small and isolated people, is a serious expense. Take the instance supplied by the United StatesAs colonies, we limited their commerce preventedtheir growth, and kept them as infants in swaddlingclothes. We mis-governed them through our poo.nobility and their hangers-on, until they could bearit no longer, and willed themselves into being asnation. Then, as a nation, the United States becameone of our first and best customers, and thesetwo nations have gone on ever since—except inone fit madness and war—improving and benefittingeach other by their mutual growth and in-terrchange. As between America and England, it is quiteClear that Nature has pointed out the Oregon as acousin, if not a brother of Uncle Sam. The Americansneed not go to war, in order to receive it. Lettime and nature have their course, and an Americanpopulation will be found in possession of it,with American sympathies and wants, and Americansrelations. All their social ties will be in theAmerican states, and those States will be, to theOregonists, what England was to the Pilgrim fathers. Those sympathies will grow into Americannationality. But, not withstanding the menacing tones of manyof your members of Congress and he Notice, itcannot be but that our Free Trade teaching andacting will convert the commercial men and thefarmers of your country into advocates of pence. Commerce is essentially peaceful. Its object isexchange, and exchange is beneficial, and , consequently, mutually desired. It is powerful, also,asa motive, as well as peaceful, because it makes itthe interest of both parties to be at peace. Thereare few moods belonging to human agents that donot yield to a sense of interest, when that interestis permanent and always acting. The mutual necessities and common interests ofthe two nations will bring them to an agreement,I trust and believe . Free trade is the essential doctrine. Morals, manners, liberty and truth, wealth,enjoyment and happiness, are all connected withcommercial activity. Supply the physical man,and you rear the intellectual man. The intellectualman must be formed out of the physical man.You cannot grow intellect out of a starred man.supply the physical, and you sow the seen of intellectualfruits. It is out of our wants that ourvirtues grow. I cut the following from the League newspaper,the organ of 'The League,' who may be styled thefathers of Commercial Freedom: The papers laid on the table o the House ofCommons on Monday night, and ordered to beprinted, exhibit some very interesting results.  The first of these is an account of the number ofVessels, the amount of tonnage, and the number oftheir crews, on the 31st of December in each year,from 1820 to 1844. In 1820, the number of vessels was 35,374, the tonnage2,648,593,the number of men employed 174,514.In 1841, there were 30,052 vessels, of 3,512,480 tons,Manned by 210,198 men. In 1844, there were31,320 vessels, of 3,637,231 tons, and 216,250 seamen. The number of British vessels entered inwards in1832, was 10,762, whose united burden was 1,936,846tons; the foreign vessels were 3865, of 561,047 tons.In 1846 , the number of British vessels was 15,964,and their tonnage 3,669,853; the number of foreignvessels 7,895, and their tonnage 1,353,735. The declared value of British and Irish produceand manufacture exported from the United Kingdomto foreign countries and our colonial possessionswas in Table  Table  The net revenue of the customs, and the amountof duty received from corn, from 1839 to 1845, wereas follows: Table  Table  With respect to the silk trade, the returns are extremely full, but we have only room for one or twoextracts. The quantity of silk of all kinds enteredfor home consumption in 1814 was 2,119,974 lbs.; in1824 it had risen to 4,011,048 lbs, but in 1834 it hadonly reached 4,522,351 lbs., while in 1844 it amountedto 6,208,021 lbs. The declared value of British silk goods exportedfrom the Untied Kingdom in each year between 1828and 1845, exhibits since the year 1835 a comparativedecrease. The value of the silk exported in 1826 was168,801;but in 1835 this amount had increased to973,786; in 1837 it had fallen to 603,673; and althoughfrom that time the value declared continuesto increases, it had in 1845 only reached 764,424.  The quantities of foreign silk manufactures retainedfor home consumption since the removal of theprohibition upon them in 1826 , exhibit a gradual risefrom 115,278 lbs. in 1827. to 310,153 lbs. in 1845. The table respecting wool and woolen manufacturesis especially interesting, but we have only spaceto give a few of the results, which prove that an increasedimportation has had the effect of increasinginstead of lowering the price of domestic produce. In1824, the number of pounds of foreign and coloniesWool imported was 22,564,485; and the price ofSouthdown wool is2d. a pound. In the followingyear, the duty on colonial wool was removed, theimport increased to 43,816,966 lbs, and the priceof Southdown wool simultaneously rose to 1s.4d.pound. During the next twenty years, the price fluetuatedfrom 2d. to 1s. 8d. a pound, and in 1843 inwas at 11 1-2d., with an import of 47,785,061 lbs. In1844, the duty on foreign wool was entirely removedthe quantity entered for consumption increased to65,079,,624 lbs., and the price of English wool rose aonce to 1s .2d . In 1845, the amount imported barfurther increased to 76,828,152 lbs., and the price odomestic wool had risen to 1s . 4d. Between 1831 and 1845, the declared value of British exports of woolen manufactures had risen from5,789,124 to 8,741,728. In 1842 , the total amount of revenue, exclusive onthe corn duties, was 32,178,814; in 1845,it was33,415,431, although during that period the amount The amount of reduction in the public expenditure effected by the repeal of the duties on auctionand glass, in 1845, is not less than 52,636. A number of extracts from the letters of glass manufacturers in every part of the kingdom, stating thimmenseincrease of consumption consequent uponthe removal of the glass duty, is appended to theimportant paper from which we have made these extracts.' Add to all this, the exchange which your largeParticipation in this great commercial activity give.to your continent, and then let us ask, is it worthwhile to go to war for a barren territory, and convert all this peace-inducing activity into war, violence and destruction? I am, yours faithfully, EDWARD SEARCH WM. LLOYD GARRISON. M. LOYD ARRISON.
