 ☞The Nashville (Tenn.) Presbyterians Witnesssays—'If the slavery question is only put to rest,the people of the United States may think themselvesfortunate in being permitted to suffer ansight years' pressures in money matters. Betterthat all the banks should close, that real estateshould depreciate twice fifty per cent, that our wivesand daughters should come, once more, to the spinningwheel and loom, and that all the Flora MeFlimseyson Madison Square should continue to have"nothing to wear," than that the slavery agitationshould go on. We are quite willing to pay theprice, at whatever temporary inconvenience and evensuffering, if by paying it, peace may only be secured.' Presbyterians Witness
