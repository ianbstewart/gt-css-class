In the letters to Mr. Forsyth and Mr. Nelson, ourMinisters at Madrid, by Mr. Adams, then Secretaryof State, our Government express a determinationthat Great Britain shall not take the island as theprice of her mediation between the then contendingpowers. Spain appears desirous of our assistance inpreserving to her the island. During Mr. Adams'administration, while Mr. Clay was Secretary ofState, the Spanish Secretary of State made thedeclaration that Spain had no intention of partingwith the island of Cuba to Great Britain or anyEuropean power. In the instructions given to Mr. A.H. Everett,Mr. Clay states that 'Great Britain is fully awarethat the United States could not consent to her occupationof those islands [Cuba and Porto Rico] underany contingencies whatever.' During the administrationof Jackson and Van Buren, remonstranceswere sent to Mexico against any attempt ofthat power to excite an insurrection of slaves inCuba. As late as 1840, instruction were given toour Minister in Spain to protest against the cessionof Cuba to any other power, and private intimationswere made to the English Minister at Madrid that itmight be an occasion of war on our part DuringMr. Polk's administration, Mr. Buchanan, Secretaryof State, says 'We should be compelled to resist theacquisition of Cuba by any powerful maritime State,with all the moans which Providence has placed atour command.' In his instructions to Mr. RomulusSaunders, Mr. &, says: 'Should the Government ofSpain feel disposed to part with the island of Cuba,the question, what we should offer for it? would thenarise.' He says, 'that the sum of $50,000,000 wouldbe an ample pecuniary indemnity to Spain.' He alsodeclares that 'the President believes that the crisishas arrived when an effort should be made to purchasethe Island of Cuba from Spain, and he hasdetermined to entrust you [Mr. Saunders] with theperformance of this moot delicate and importantduty.' Mr. B. then describes toe manner in whichthe negotiation is to be carried on, and asserts that'the President would be willing to stipulate for thepayment of one hundred millions of dollars' as amaximum price. Mr. Sanders, in his reply, showsthe difficulties in the way of purchase, particularlythose of the private pecuniary interest which theQueen Mother bad in Havana. He found, however,the Government willing to treat upon the subject,provided there was any attempt an the part of theCubans to obtain their independence, but that theyplaced a higher value upon it. The negotiations,however, were in vain. The Spanish Ministry repliedthat it was more than any one dared to do, tomention the subject in public, for that lbs Spaniardswould prefer to see the island sunk in the oceanrather than in the possession of any other power, andthe proposition was courteously I but absolutelydeslived. one hundred millions of dollars provided there was any attempt an the part of theCubans to obtain their independence
