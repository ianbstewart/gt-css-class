It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slavery. Its reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of the nation is to establish an artificialmajority in the slave representation over that of thetree people, in the American less Congress, and therebyto make the PRESERVATION, PROPAGATIONAND PERPETUATION OF SLAVERY THE VITALAND ANIMATING SPIRIT OF THE NATIONALGOVERNMENT:—JOHN QUINCY ADAMS  OHN UINCY DAMS
