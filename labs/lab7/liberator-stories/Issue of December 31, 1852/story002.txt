Romans 2:2—'There is no respect of person with Colossians 3:15—'He that doeth wrong shall re  for th wrong which he hath done; and thereno respect of persons.' Proverbs 24:23—'It is not good to have respect of in judgment.'  By these, and a great many other passages, both inthe Old and the New Testament, we are assured thatand certainly will judge men impartially; and are admishedthat we should endeavor to do likewise,—our decisions upon the characters orproduct of men to be warped by any regard to theiractive position in society—their exaltation or theirdepression— their wealth or their poverty—their learningor their ignorance. The memorable command ofby Moses is, 'Thou shalt do no unrighteousnessjudgment; thou shalt not respect the person of thenor honor the person of the mighty; but inrighteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.' Lev.15 And one of the old proverbs reads thus—with unto the wicked, Thou art righteous,shall the people curse, and nations shall abhor impartially     True, we are cautioned to beware how we judge—to be hasty in pronouncing the condemnation ofby one; not to rejoice in detecting iniquity—tolike all fair and generous allowances; nay, more, tomerciful as we ourselves hope for mercy. But circumstances require of us a decision uponin particular acts, or the general character of anythem, then are we bound by every principle of justiceand a common humanity to decide impartially, withany respect of persons. The man of mightiest intellect,even though he occupy the most elevated positionin the State or the Church, is held by the sameof obligation to do right, and to keep himself un from the world, as is the humblest one of allthe sons of earth. He that hath ten talents committedto him, will be called to just as strict an accounthe who has but one; Jesus Christ foretells,in the judgment of the Most High, many thatfirst in the regards of men will be last, and manyare last will be first.   withany respect of persons.   A just judgment, however, either here or hereafter,in any case, rest merely upon the ostensible of that case; also upon the ability of theperson, whose deeds are in question, to know and tothat which is right. ostensible  The errors, therefore, that are doubtless committedmen, in their judgments of one another, are oftenthe attributed to their incapacity. They are reallyable to take into due consideration the incidentalcases of the misconduct which they condemn. Butprincipal reason why human judgments are oftenunequal, and otherwise unjust—the principal reasonwhy they often bear so little resemblance to dijudgements, is that they are perverted,—pervertedthe very influence which we see to be so explicitlyhidden in our sacred Scriptures—I mean, respect of So common, so controlling is this influence,it, with little exaggeration, it might be said preover the tribunals of earth—generally over thecommon opinions that are pronounced upon actions,often over the decision of our courts of justice.a common remark, that if men of high degree fall into the hands of the law, they will be more tenderly than men of a lower class.The poor, the ignorant, those who are hauled to judgmentfrom the squalid abodes of povertyare likely to fare worse, to be disposed of more for the same offences, than the rich—thoseto dwell in palaces, and come before their judges inattire. The deference that in our country isto 'men of high degree,' is scarcely less than despotic or monarchical governments, where ittaken as an axiom of state, that 'the king can dono wrong;' or that, if princes and lords do commitoffences, (unless they be offences against thethey are not to be treated as common felons.all this is contrary to the divine administrationjustice, and scarcely less at variance with the fundamentalprinciples of our civil polity. One of theterrible peculiarities of the system of Americanslavery, under which more than three millions of thepeople of our country are governed, is, that althoughsubjects of that republic despotism are kept in exiignorance, yet are they punished much more sethan white men for the same offences; and,moreover, many acts committed by them are accountand punished as crimes, yes, capital crimes, which,the same things were done by white men, wouldbe unnoticed, or perhaps be applauded.  respect of         How, I do not say that the inequalities in the administrationof justice or of public opinion among thediverse classes of white men n our land are so glaras in the case just cited; but I do say they are, yes great enough to fill with alarm the bosomof every True Democrat, and every real Christian.for example:   Let a man who was born in a brothel, and brought drum-shop—who has never attended school ain his life, and seldom if ever seen the inside ofa church —who from his infancy has breathed an atmosphereladen with the fumes of whiskey and tobaccoand who has heard, every hour, the language ofprofanity and obscenity—let such a man become lewddistemperate, and we hear of no attempt to screenfrom condemnation—to make apologies for hisand should he commit a larceny, steal a sheepwith yard of cloth, there will be no hesitation amongotherwise and prudent to brand him as a thief, treatas a felon, hurry him to the jail and the penitentary,and ever afterwards regard him with distrust ifaversion, and withhold from him all opportunitiesadvise to respectability.  But let a man of high degree, a man gifted by Godin surpassing intellectual powers, and aided in thedevelopment of his powers by the best literary andscientific institution in the land; a man, too, who hasenjoyed the blessings of a home of peace, purity andplenty, the instructions and example of wise andpious parents, and has been accustomed to hear thelessons of Christian doctrine and duty enforced fromthe pulpit with wisdom and eloquence,—let such afavored man, especially if he possesses large wealth,or occupies a high official station, let such a manbecome loose in his principles, and licentious in hishabits, let him launch into expenses which he cannotafford, borrow money for the continuance of his pleasuresor his business, and never repay it; let him becomelibidinous and drunken: and, if he be a statesman, sell himself and his party for the attainment ofthe object of his ambition, and you shall find manyready to veil, to extenuate, to excuse, to deny, even,his vices. Charity will plead, that the trials andtemptations of the great are severer far than ordinaryminds and hearts can even conceive. Those whodare to condemn such a man are themselves denouncedas censorious and cruel, ungrateful for his services,and unmindful of the feelings of his fond relatives.The brilliancy of the mental gifts bestowed upon suchan offender, and the halo of his high social or officialposition, forbids the approach of a common criticismupon the immorality of his conduct. Now, all thisis unequal, unjust, and utterly inconsistent in thosewho assume to be the followers, especially the ministersof Jesus Christ. That wisest, holiest, loveliest ofthe sons of men, that dearly beloved Son of God,showed no such partiality in his judgments of sinners.He was most explicit, most severe, in his condemnationof the great men of his day and nation—the menwho filled the highest places in the State and theChurch, and who were reputed to be the most learnedand most pious men of their time—the scribes, thePharisees, the Doctors of the Law, the jurists, therulers, ay, the chief priest, the governor, and kinghimself. Those were the men whose vices Jesustook the most pains to expose, and on whom he pronouncedthe severest censures that ever fell from thelips of s righteous indignation. That benignantbrother of the whole human family, that impartialSon of the Heavenly Father, saw in his day, as weall may see in our day, if we will, that far betterapologies may be made for the vices of the poor, theignorant, the publicans, yea, even the harlots, thanfor the vices of the rich, the educated, those who haveenjoyed the advantages of the best society, and of thehighest literary and religious institutions of the day,and have the means to supply every want and gratifyevery, reasonable wish. 'To whomsoever much is given,of him shall much be required.' This principleof just judgment is commended to us by our Savior,and it ought always to preside over the tribunalsof earth, as it assuredly will preside at the judgmentseat of Christ. great men We may, indeed, not readily assume to be competentto the work of judgment. It would be wise inus (whenever we may) to excuse ourselves from undertakingit. But whenever we an required to pronouncean opinion upon the conduct and character ofa fellow-man, dead or alive, we should see to it thatour judgment be as impartial as it may be; certainly,that it be baaed upon the principles of divine justice,which shows no respect of persons, and proportionsits demands to the ability of each individual. The prevailing vices of every age always have beenand still are entrenched behind the example and influenceof the men and women of high degree, theprosperous, the wealthy, the refined, the elegant—thosewho an exalted in Church or in State—and heonly who has the Christian courage to expose and denouncethose vices in high places, and show them tohe even more inexcusable to men and more odious toGod then than elsewhere, be only can be the instrumentof any essential reform. Take, for instance, thehorrid vice of intemperance, which, alas! is only toepertinent on the present occasion. That vice is notencouraged and kept in countenance by the exampleof the poor inebriate, who, in his rags and filth, isseen staggering through the street or lying in the gutter.He is rather an admonition, an awful warning.But that loathsome, desolating vice is upheld, encouraged,disseminated, by the men and women in thecommunity who have the ability to give to the indulgencesthat lead to that vice, the sanction of a commandinginfluence; who have the wealth to throwaround those indulgences, the halo of elegance andfashion. Take another example, from that great national inequity,slavery, of which I must needs speak in connectionwith the sad subject of my discourse to-night.That system of tremendous wickedness is not now,and never has been, upheld by the miserable driversand overseen, who keep up the working of the plantations;nor by the execrated kidnappers and slave-traders,who supply the markets for human cattle. Itis not such men as Haley and Legree who make thatsystem tolerable in the regards of any portion of thecivilized world, end have seduced even many of theministers of religion in our land to throw over it thesanction of their names and their sacred office. O,no! It is the influence of those renowned statesmenwhose voices have, for so many years, been heard inthe councils of our nation,—whose wisdom and eloquencehave controlled our public opinions and shaped ourlegislation. They are the individuals who arechiefly responsible for the responsibility of thatatrocious system, under which more than one sixth ofthe population of the land an held in a condition ofdomesticated brutes —more than three millions ofmen and women are enslaved, who have as good aright to liberty as those magnates themselves. O, no!It is not the poor, ignorant, degraded agents and toolsof the Southern aristocrats, who era to be especiallyblamed for the slavery in our land, with its told anduntold abominations—American slavery! which hassullied the fame of our Republic, thrown a dark, portentouscloud over our own future, and blighted thehopes of crushed humanity, that has so fondly lookedto this star in the West, as the harbinger of a gloriousday of freedom. O, no! It is not the wretched beingsin human form, who wield the whip and fastenthe chain, who keep the slave pens, and preside overthe auction-blocks,—it is not they who have maintained,nor such as they who can hereafter maintain'the peculiar institution of the South'—an institutionso peculiar, that every thing else in the land must besubordinated to its interests. O, ! But it is thosemen of giant intellects, those astute lawyers, thosepracticed statesmen, those men whose eloquence wouldmake the legislators of the nation quail, and send atremor throughout the land; whose logic could makethe worse seem the better reason, obscure the light ofthe self-evident truths of our world-renowned Declaration  of Independence; almost persuade the menof this day that properly should be held by governmentsin more sacred regard than humanity; and bring themto believe that the claim of the right to liberty for allmen was only a rhetorical flourish of the fanatical leadersof our Revolution. They, they are the men,who, by their personal and official influence, havedone more than all others to uphold slavery—that execrablesystem of blighting, crushing oppression, inthe midst of our Republic. Unless, therefore, we canimpair, yes. destroy the influence of those men uponthe minds and hearts of our people, I see not but that,for a generation to come, our nation in to be given upto a cruel idolatry, which they have sanctioned; bebound in obedience to a lower law, which they haveenshrined above the law of God; and be accustomedto deny all practical faith in that blessed religionwhich commands us to relieve the suffering, protectthe injured, break the yoke of the oppressed; in oneword, do unto others as we would that they shoulddo unto us. properly should be held by governmentsin more sacred regard than humanity; the right to liberty for allmen was only a rhetorical flourish But, notwithstanding the immense influence ofthose great men, to whom I refer, upon the legislationand public sentiment of our country, I have still thefaith to believe, that the influence of truth, and of thespirit of humanity, and the spirit of God, are yetgreater. In the inspiration of that faith, I speakto-night. Three of the mightiest of those men, to whom Ihave referred, have lately departed this life. And astheir great shades recede from us into the invisibleworld, there are solemn thoughts suggested, fromwhich we should not turn away. They hare gone into the ineffable presence of Himwho is the source of all power, all wisdom, all excellence.They cannot there be admired for the surpassinggifts of intellect which the Creator bestowedupon them. To God, not to them, belongs the gloryof the talents they were entrusted with. They standbefore Him, who is no respecter of persons, not to beapplauded for having what He gave them, but to rendera strict account of the use they have made of thetrust. There they stand, no longer veiled by any ofthe disguises, evasions, sophistries, pleas of expediencyand state policy, by which they may justifiedthemselves to their human admirers. They standbefore the King of kings, who, if the Scriptures ofthe Old and New Testaments are to be taken as anytranscript of his divine mind, abhors oppression; and,if the history of nations may be supposed to give anyintimations of his moral government, will throw downthe proudest monarchs, overturn the mightiest governments,and utterly destroy whatsoever sets itself up inopposition to his impartial law—whatsoever and whosoeveroppresses the poor, or is cruel to the needy.Before the benignant Father of the whole humanfamily, those men now stand to justify themselves, ifthey can, for having exerted the transcendent powershe gave them, to uphold the most execrable systemof oppression the children of men ever groanedunder. abhors oppression; What will be their pleas, think you r It is impossiblewholly to restrain thought in that direction. Iwould reverently put the questions which rush intomy mind. What will be their pleas? The same, doyou suppose, that they urged upon the American Congressand people? Will they to His face allege thatit is a part of the economy of the universal Father,his plan from the beginning, that a portion of hisearthly family should be oppressed, crushed, enslaved,although he has in all ages brought calamity uponthose who have enforced oppression? Will they,think you, intimate to Him, that the colored people ofthis country are the descendants of Ham, and thereforecondemned by His own curse to be bondmen;and that American slavery is in accordance with hisdivine decree? Will they intimate this to him, whosedivine providence made it self-evident to their father,more than seventy years ago, that God had created allmen to be free! self-evident created allmen to be free Or will they, think you, plead at the tribunal onhigh, that the difference of complexion, which theCreator was pleased to give to the natives of Africaand their descendants, was an insuperable barrier tothe flow of justice, mercy, brotherly kindness towardsthem; will they plead this to Him, who, in theplenitude of his power, wisdom and love, made all thevarieties of beings and things, that the music of Creationmight not be a monotone, but a glorious harmony?Or Will they, as statesmen, urge that the Unionof the United States could not be perpetuated, withouta compromise of all the rights of a large portionof the people; will they urge this, think you, to theAlmighty One, in whose sight no nation is or can beexalted but by righteousness? Will they urge thepreservation of this Union as a valid reason for thecruelty they advised, to Him who ages ago inspired anoble soul of the old world to utter that glorioussentiment which the true-hearted of all ages sincehave delighted to own, 'Fiat justifiable, rust !'Can you suppose that in His presence, those men willhold up the United States Constitution as a greaterauthority, a higher law than the Constitution of theMoral Universe, which God himself ordained? Theydid this—they offered all these pleas for slavery, whileon earth—will they, think you, venture to offer themat the her of the all-holy and impartial One? I presumeyou will, all of you, answer these question asI should. Fiat justifiable, rust   Calhoun, Clay. Webster, hare gone to an unerringJudge in the unseen world. They have also left theirwords and works on earth, to be judged of men. Undoubtedly,in due time, their award will also be arighteous one. But, at present, opinions have beengiven of their characters and conduct which seem tome to be so dangerously erroneous, and commendationshave been bestowed upon them (especially thelast named) so utterly undeserved, that, as a lover ofliberty, end a believer in the righteousness of Christ,I am compelled to dissent. I should, however, haveremained silent, and have left the judgment of ourday respecting Mr. Webster, to be reversed, if it oughtto be, by an impartial posterity, had not his blind admirersthrust upon me, as one of the guardians ofthe public morals, the duty of taking exceptions totheir unmeasured commendations of him. As if deprecating the investigation of his character,which is now Inevitable, Mr. Webster, a few hoursbefore his decease, read aloud, or required an attendantto read, these beautiful lines of the poet Gray: 'No farther seek his merits to disclose,Nor draw his frailties from their dread abode;Then they alike in trembling hope repose.The bosom of his Father and his God.'    If Mr. W's idolaters had not utterly disregarded thefirst part of this dying request, I. for one, should havefelt no obligation pressing me to disregard the latterpar'. If they had ascribed to him only the meritsthat were unquestionably his, I should have forborneto say aught of his vices. But the streets of our nation,and the newspapers, have been filled with ascriptionsof virtues to Mr. Webster which he did not posts;and the pulpits of the land have resounded withepithets, which should be applied only to the mosteminent Christian saint He has been called the 'sumof all human greatness'—' the star of the world'—' alight brighter than the sun.' He has been held upto the nation, not only as a peerless statesman, but as'the model man—' the illustrious Christian.' Werethese the extravagant eulogists of one or two besottedworshipers, we might let them pass. But hisobsequies have every when been so ordered, that thevoices of cities, of States, of the nation, have beenmade to utter this inordinate praise. Such praise, sobestowed, confounds all moral distinctions. As apreacher of the justice, the mercy, the temperance,the chastity which the Gospel inculcates, I must protest,that Daniel Webster should not be set on highbefore my countrymen as a pattern statesman, or anexemplary man. I have in my bosom much of thatfeeling which prompted the oft-quoted Latin adage,'De mortuis nil nisi bonum.' When the inexorablehand of death, as when a stroke of blighting misfortune,has fallen upon any one, the kind-hearted arewont to deal most tenderly with the sufferer. Thisis a beautiful instinct of our common humanity, andI hate even to seem to violate it. 'The grave certainlyshould bury personal and party feelings, but,'as one of the purest, holiest spirits of our day has saidin reference to this very case, 'but not moral distinctionfor they are more venerable than any man, andmore precious than any personal service.' De mortuis nil nisi bonum. moral distinction It is the more painful to me to speak, as I must, ofone whom I once venerated so highly. Mr. Webstercame to reside in Boston, where I then lived, when Iwas nineteen years of age. I was among the youngmen who, on all occasions, when he spoke, hung uponhis lips, awed by his wisdom, enraptured by his eloquence.I have seen the grave Senate of Massachusetts,and vast assemblies of the people, enchained byhis words, as if by s spell, and borne on the wings ofhis thought as it were by an irresistible power. WhenI heard or read the humane, the glorious sentimentshe was went to utter in those days, believing him tobe sincere, how did I almost worship him! Weused then to speak of him with an enthusiasm of admiration,scarcely less extravagant than the Jews wereguilty of respecting David. We called him the godlike. The first anti-slavery meeting I ever attended wasin 1819, convened to withstand the Missouri Compromise.Of that Convention, Mr. Webster was theleading spirit. Then and there, by him and others,generous, humane, Christian sentiments were uttered,which kindled in my bosom a warmth or sympathyfor the oppressed of oar lead, that has never cooled,and, I trust in the Father of my spirit, never willcool. The next year, at Plymouth, on the 22d of December,he delivered an oration, which will be readand admired as long as any thing that ever came fromhis giant intellect. And no passage in it will be rememberedlonger than that in which he denouncedthe slave trade, and summoned the American pulpitto do its duty in the cause of the enslaved. If thequestion bad been put, between the years 1819 and1829, who was the moat prominent champion of libertyin our country, I have no doubt the response wouldare been, by common acclaim, Daniel Webster.From that year to 1840, he was much less explicit andactive then the friends of humanity felt that he oughthave been, in consistency with his avowed principles.He left the old men eloquent, John QuincyAdams, to fight the battle for freedom in Congress,almost single—handed against the Southern host; andwith not a word from his lips to sustain or encouragehim. Yet, in 1837, Mr. Webster showed, in hisspeech in Niblo's Garden, that he justly appreciatedthe anti-slavery movement, fathomed the spiritualdepth from which it sprung, and foresaw the impossibilityof staying its onward march. But, in 1840, he allowed himself to become theHigh Priest of the Whig party. A Presidential electionwas then pending. The incumbent of that office,for the preceding four years, was again in nomination.He had gained that elevation by his subserviencyto the Slave Power; and by renewed protestationof his fealty, was hoping to continue himselfthe man whom the slaveholders would still delightto honor. Mr. Van Buren's held upon the Presidential chaircould be loosed only by the influence of a man whocould give to the South the assurance that 'the peculiarinstitution' would be as safe if not safer in his hands,and that of his party, than it had been or would be,with the then present incumbent and his supporters.For this purpose, General Harrison was selected by theWhigs, and wisely, s the children of this worldcount wisdom. he had been for several years a residentin Ohio, but he was the son of a slaveholder,'descended,' as Mr. Webster emphatically said in hiselectioneering speeches, 'descended from the bestVirginia stock;' which meant, that he was a son ofone of the most aristocratic lords of the soil in theAncient Dominion, and one of the largest owners ofhuman cattle. William Henry Harrison, therefore,had been born and educated in the midst of theseinfluences, which Mr. Jefferson had shown to be sodestructive to the sentiments of liberty and humanityin the become of children. No evidence couldbe found by his political opponents, that in emigratingfrom a land of oppressors, he had left the spiritof oppression behind him. True, he had caused, of on removing into Ohio, to be a slaveholderbut in all his public acts, bearing on the subjects ofslavery, he had always been in favor not merely of itscontinuance, but of its extension. While Governorof the Territory of Indians, Gen. II. used his officialterritory, contrary to the act of Congress, by which it hadbeen for ever excluded. While a member of Congressin 1819 and 1820, he voted for the admission of Missouri,with a Constitution sanctioning slavery; andthus he consented to an act which, under the name ofCompromise, delivered the free States and free laborinto the hands of the Slave Power. While a candidatefor the Presidency in 1836, he uttered the sentiment,in a public speech, that the citizens of the freeStates have no Constitutional right even to discussthe subject of slavery, which sentiment he re-affirmedafter his second nomination, in 1840. Gen. II.maintained, too, the doctrine that Congress had nopower by the Constitution to abolish slavery in theDistrict of Columbia, without the consent of the slaveStates; and, moreover, he gave his encouragementand assistance in Kentucky, in procuring the passageby the Legislature of Ohio of the infamous law whichmade it criminal to give food and shelter to fugitivesfrom slavery.  slavery After all these acts, it was impossible to doubt thatGeneral Harrison was still a slaveholder at heart.Yet such was the man (and because he was such aman) that the Whig party found it expedient to nominatefor the Presidency. And such was the manthat Mr. Webster went about the country laboring toelect. In the presence of a large gathering of Southerners,in the city of Alexandria, and again, a fewdays afterwards, before a larger assemblage in Richmond,in the full blaze of an October's sun, he madedeclarations, which as interpreted on the spot by Mr.Crittenden, to whom he appealed, gave the SlavePower to understand, that Mr. Webster himself, andthe Northern Whigs generally, were as much opposedto the anti-slavery movement as the slaveholderscould be. It was then and there that this giant of the Northwas shorn of his strength. He bent his knee; he laidhimself down on the lap of the Slave Power. I fearedthat he would never stand erect again. He neverhas. Mr. Webster's fall should be dated as far backas 1840; though, alas! he reached a lower depth inMarch, 1830. I know that he continued to ever thathe was the friend of liberty, and many hoped and believedthat ho would yet vindicate his title to thatname. He opposed, it is true, the annexation of Texas.But he did not oppose it as openly, as heartily,as fearlessly as he ought to have done. He did not gothrough the land, laboring with his might to avert thatevil, as he did to enforce upon us the ratification ofthe Fugitive Slave Law. I was a member of the greatWhig Convention in Boston, January, 1845, that wascalled to withstand the annexation of Texas; and Iwell remember, that the Convention was chagrined,and somewhat embarrassed by his refusal to give it hisOpen countenance. Certain great cotton merchantsand leading Whigs were unwilling that he should;and so the Convention was left to lament his absence,as did the Grecian host, in an hour of theirutmost need, lament the absence of their Achilles. In 1843, the anti-slavery men of various name anddegree essayed to make some demonstration of theirunited strength. They formed the Free Soil party onthe platform devised at Buffalo. Their numbers weretoo imposing to be ignored. The demand they madefor Humanity was too moderate to be dented by anyone, who had not avowedly entered into a league withthe oppressors of our country. Mr. Webster sawthis. and attempted playfully to pass off the sayingsand doings of that Convention as an old story, whichhe had often told. He claimed the Wilmot Proviso(which was the basis of the Buffalo platform) ashis own thunder, and insisted that the other principle,laid down at Buffalo, were so similar to the doctrinesof the Whigs, that for himself and his political associatesto identify themselves with the Free8oil party would be no more than merely to changetheir name. Very many, deceived by these declarations,believed that he was what he used to be in hisearlier days, and that when the crisis came, be wouldstand forth the champion of the inalienable rights ofman. The crisis came. A bill of abominations was prepared.I need not now repeat the details of it. The head andfront of ha offending was the provision for the renditionof fugitives from slavery. The hearts of all who retainedany confidence la Mr. Webster, beat high with theexpectation that be would now come out, what Godmade him to be, the glorious defender of the right.His confidential friends in Boston were sure he wouldtake strong ground against the Compromise measures,and place himself and the Whig party dearly on theside of freedom. At Washington, it was an open secretthat he meant to do so. Indeed, he had a conferencewith another distinguished Whig member of theSenate, had agreed with him that the true course ofpolicy, as well as of right, was to oppose the Compromisemeasures; and gave him to understand that, atproper time, they both should speak, and take the sameposition against that monster of iniquity. The 7th of March came, however, and with it thatwhich, alas! can never be forgotten. Thatspeech, which published to the world Daniel Webster's to liberty and the rights of man. So muchhas been said in this hall, or elsewhere in the hearingof most of you, my fellow-citizens, respecting thatspeech, and the measures which it advocated, that Ineed not spread the matter out before you now. Thatwas the great mistake of his life. Probably, at was theself inflicted would that caused his death. He was toowise a man not to know that be had done wrong; andstill too good a man to be a peace with that wrong. published to the world Daniel Webster's  To defer, for a few minutes, the consideration ofits moral depravity, let me now say, that speechwas a marvelous instance of bad policy. It wouldseem, that in t at hour he must have lost all his sityas a statesman. The avowed intention of thoseCompromise measures was to settle the question of slavery,which has so long agitated our country, by puttingdown all further discussion of it. Preposterousattempt! Mr. Webster must so far have forgotten himselfas to have supposed that the people of the UnitedStates were to be managed, and put to  like thesubjects of the E of  or of the C or of the Turkish . He must have utterlyforgotten his own prophetic words in Niblo's garden,March, 1837. Hear, what he there said:—        On the general question of slavery, a great portionof the community is already strongly excited. Thesubject has not only attracted attention as a questionof politics, but it has struck a far deeper-toned chord.It has arrested the religions feeing of the country: itto has taken a strong hold on the consciences of men. Heis a rash man, indeed, and but little conversant withhuman nature, and especially has he a very erroneousestimate of the character of the people of this country,who supposes that a feeling of this kind is to be trifledwith or despised. * * * But to coerce it into silence,to endeavor to restrain its free expression, to seekto compress and conue it, warm as it is, and more heatedas such endeavors would inevitably render it—should,this be attempted. I know nothing, even in the Constitutionor in the Union itself, which would not be endangeredby the explosion which might follow.'  These were his own words; and yet he was the manto give his sanction, ay, to pledge all his personal andofficial influence in behalf of precisely such a mad attempt.You, fellow-citizens, were witnesses, many ofyou active members of a meeting held in this hall, andhundreds of meetings just like ours were held all overthe land North of Mason and Dixon's line, to huddefiance at the UKASE OF OUR REPUBLICAN CEAR.Every when Daniel Webster was shown to be a trueprophet in 1837; and an infatuated statesman in1850. 'I am willing to be reasoned with,' said theHon. Horace Mann, in his electrifying speech on the17th of August last— I am wilting to be reasonedwith, and am always grateful when, for good cause, Iam convinced; but when an attempt is made to takefrom me all option in regard to my exercise of a clearright, I find a sufficient motive for exercising my rightin the more art of disobedience.' At an earlier day, theveteran Giddings said in the House of Representatives,Congress has presumed to say,' (I quote hiswords from memory.)' Congress has presumed to saythe subject of slavery must not be any more discussed.Well, I am hen discussing it now. I mean todiscuss it more than I have ever done; as much as Ithink it ought to be discussed; and, gentlemen, whatwill you do about it?' Those men spoke like truerepublicans; like men who understood their rights,and the rights of their constituents; and their wordsof defiance met a cordial response from millions ofhearts. Tell a true democrat that he shall not speakon any subject, and he will talk about it continually,and about little else. Why, if Mr. Webster, andthose who devised 'the peace measures,' had reallyintended to summon the whole people to a war ofwords on the subject of slavery, they could not havedone it more effectually. There have been morespeeches made on the forbidden theme, more columnsin our newspapers devoted to it, and morepamphlets published since March, 1850, than in allthe years before, from the day when the anti-slaverycontroversy commenced! Ay, and a book upon slaveryhas come forth from the hand of a lady, which isthe phenomenon of the press. Since last March, UncleTom's Cabin' has been multiplied by ten-fold morecopies than were ever made of any other book in thesame length of time. It has bean translated into twoother—the most widely-spoken languages;—andmore copies of it an now circulating, the world over,than any other book extant, excepting only the Bible.It seems as if it were a scroll borne through the earthon angels' wings, summoning every nation, kindredand people to unite with one accord, in condemnationof our Republican Despotism. The author has let inthe sunlight or a liberty-loving soul upon the darkprison-house; and daguerreotyped the scene, that all,who have eyes and hearts, may behold it and abhor.So much for the attempt to put a stop to the discussionof slavery:  KASE OF OUR EPUBLICAN EAR. more art of disobedience. the phenomenon of the press. But the mistaken policy of the measure, which Mr. Websterespoused on the 7th of March, was by nomeans the worst part of it; the iniquity, theinhumanity of it was more deplorable. It will throw adeep shade over his future fame. It put a stain uponhis character that will grow blacker, as the sun ofliberty rises nearer to the meridian, and pours its intenserrays upon that act. A report is in circulation, that on his death-bed Mr.Webster said, that act was the great mistake of his life.I hope he did make that confession. If he did, Ishould believe that he was indeed alive at the last;alive to the glorious sentiments, the generous purposes,the humane feelings of his naturally nobleheart. act was the great mistake of his life. Did I know assuredly that he made that confession,I should of course waive all further consideration ofhis 'great transgression.' But many will not believe,and some deny that he said aught of the kind. Thetrial therefore must proceed. I hope there is no ground for the suspicion, whichrests to heavily upon Mr, Webster's unexpected procedureon the 7th of March, that it was induced bypromises, or intimations plainly given by the SlavePower, which rules our nation, that such a courseshould be rewarded by a seat in the presidentialchair. And yet, to account for the sudden change ofhis purpose, and his subsequent conduct without supposingthe intervention of Southern, or some othersinister influence, is not easy. I hope that be was sincere. in believing that theperpetuity of the Union really demanded the measureswhich he brought himself to advocate. But if Imay believe this of his sincerity, it must be at theexpense of my respect for his wisdom and his piety.How a man, who bad been so familiar for forty years,or more, with the collisions that have been so perpetuallyrecurring between the slave States and thefree; and had known so well the articles—the threatof dissolution—by which the abettors of slavery hadalmost always carried their point-how he shouldhave been really alarmed by that artifice, I cannotunderstand. It is still more difficult to account forthis, when we consider that he might have seen, andmust have known, that the slaveholders themselveswere, and had undoubtedly heard the confessionfrom such men as Randolph Underwood andMarshall, that the dissolution of the Union would bethe signal for the sudden and violent emancipation ofthe enslaved. Especially inexplicable to us is hisfear, at that time when those indexes of public seniority,more sensitive for than th most delicate electro meters,showed in their prizes of stocks not theslightest perturbation. seniority, Most of all is it surprising that Mr. Webster shouldhave for a moment supposed that the Union could beperpetuated by measures so odious to the people ofthe free States, that he must have foreseen they wouldevery where be resisted, unless he, and the advocatesof the infernal Compromise, could succeed in utterlystultifying the people of the North; quenching thelight of liberty in their soul*; eradicating their mostcherished sentiments; convincing them that the Declarationof our Independent was only a rhetorical flourish;that property is —ore precious than humanity;and that the attempt to establish a free, democraticgovernment must be a failure.  But, supposing that he had become so bewildered,in the political fog that settles in such dense massesaround our national Capital, as not to hare seen howthe Union could have been eared, but by what Isaiahwould call 'a covenant with death and an agreementwith hell,' what right had he to comply with theterms? He that, we are told, was so familiar with theBible; read it every day; and professed such profoundreverence for its teaching; where did he getpermission to set at naught the laws of God and therights of humanity, for any consideration of personalor national aggrandizement, or continued existence,even? It is not necessary, (however desirable it maybe,) it is not necessary that the Union of these Statesshould be preserved; but it is necessary that men, allmen, the moat exalted even more than the moat abased,that men, nationally no less than individually,should 'do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly.' The dissolution of our Union would Indeed be agreat calamity, but it would not deserve to be namedas an evil, in comparison with the moral desolationwhich must overspread our country before the FugitiveSlave Law will be generally obeyed. Theoverthrow of our Union, for the sake of Liberty, wouldbe far more glorious than the overthrow of the altarswhich our fathers reared; the quenching of the firesof freedom which they kindled in our hearts; andthe utter abandonment of that great project to whichthey consecrated 'their lives, their fortunes, and theirsacred honor,' and then bequeathed it to us as theirmost precious legacy. When I remember the highpromise which our nation, at her birth, gave to oppressedhumanity throughout the earth, and compareit with the low political and moral estate to which shewould be brought by the measures which Mr. Websterat last saw fit to advocate, no pictures of civil andservile war that can be conjured up to frighten us intoacquiescence, seem in my view half so horrible. Whata humiliating confession would it be for us to makebefore the whole world, that 'the slave system is thebond of our American Union!' If I believed it, mytongue should cleave to the roof of my mouth beforeI would make that confession, unless it were, in thesame breath, to demand that this Union shouldtherefore be dissolved. for the sake of Liberty When I read over the admirable exposition whichMr. Webster gave, at Plymouth, Dec., 1820, of thetrue principles of our great republic; when I rememberthe high—souled sentiments he was wont to utterin former days; when I consider his exalted powersof understanding and eloquence, by which he mightif he would, have led our nation up to the acme ofher greatness; when I consider what he once was, andwhat he might have been, and compare it with whathe became, I am filled with feelings of sorrow andshame. Much rather would I have spoken of hismassive intellect, his generous mental culture, hisoverpowering eloquence, and of the many invaluableservices he has rendered to his fellow—citizens, as alawyer, and to his country as a civilian and statesman.But all these themes have been dwelt upon by others,far better able than myself to do them justice; andwhat they hare said, in all its truth, and all its exaggeration,is spread before the people in the countlessspeeches and discourses that have been called out byhis decease. Mine has been the ungrateful tank of taking exceptions tothe praise, which, had truth and mercy permitted,and the ability been given me, I would muchrather have swollen to a higher note. Nor is mypainful duty yet accomplished. taking exceptions tothe praise Sad, and reports are abroad all over the land, andhave been for more than ten years past, reports ofMr. Webster's depravity in his personal habits. Thesereports have been so often repeated, and to seldomcontradicted, that it is impossible not to believe therewas some foundation for them. Now, I maintain,that a man of his immense intellectual and moralpower, a man, too, holding a position in society ofsuch wide—spread and commanding influence, is whollyinexcusable, if he does not so conduct himself at the table,and in his intercourse with women, that such reportscould not attach to him, even if the blackest malignitycould set thorn on foot. whollyinexcusable, if he does not so conduct himself at the table,and in his intercourse with women I stand not hereto charge Mr. Webster with havingbeen sexually licentious; and frequently, and sometimesgrossly, intemperate. No man in the countrycould be more rejoiced than I should be, to receivethe evidence that there was no ground for thesecharges. But these charges are unequivocally made.—Thousandsin all parts of our country, both his friendsand his foes—many in our own city, some of them hispolitical allies and warm admirers, are witnesses againsthim. I therefore stand here, and am willing to standany where, to insist that, until these grievous chargesare disproved, Mr. Webster ought not to be held upto the unqualified admiration of mankind; until thesecharges are disproved, it is not fitting that he should beproclaimed 'the sum of all human greatness,' 'themodel man'; until these charges are disproved, thoseministers of the Gospel betray their trust and desecratetheir office, who eulogize him, and bear him upon their prayers before this country and all Christendom,as an illustrious follower of Jesus Christ, an exampleworthy to be imitated by the young men, whoaspire to be truly good as well as truly great. Theseheavy charges must be investigated. If they shall befound false, Mr. Webster's character will shine outall the more brightly for the dispersion of these darkclouds, that now rest upon it; and those who, asfriends of temperance and chastity, have been compelledby these charges to withhold from him theirpraise, will be all the more earnest to do him the amplestjustice, for very shame and sorrow, that theyhad believed so much evil of him. But if these chargesof debauchery and intemperance, as well as politicalapostasy, shall be sustained, the just judgment ofmankind will place him on the list of those who havebeen called But these charges are unequivocally made. 'The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind.' 'Real glory Springs from the sileut conquest of ourselves.And without that, the mightiest man is noughtBut the chiefest slave' conquest of ourselves.
