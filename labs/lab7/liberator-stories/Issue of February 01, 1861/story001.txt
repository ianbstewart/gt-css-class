 ☞"What elder of man under the most absolute ofmonarchies, or the most aristocratic of republics, was overinserted with such an odious and unjust privilege as thatof the separate and exclusive representation of thanhalf a million owners of slaves, in the Hail of this House,in the chair of the Senate, and in the Presidential mansion?This investment of power in the owners of onespecies of property contrasted in the highest authorities,of the nation, and disseminated through thirteen of thetwenty-six States of the Union, constitution a privilegedorder of men in the community, mere adverse to the rightsof all, and mere perniciousto the interest of the whole,than any order of nobility ever known. To call governmentmost thus constituted a Democracy is the insult the understandingof mankind. . . . It is doubly tainted with theinfection of riches and of slavery. There is no man inthe language of national jurisprudence that can define it—no modal in the record of ancient history, or in the politicaltheories of Aristotle, with which can be likened.  Itwas introduced into the Constitution of the United Statesby an eluviations—a representation of property under thename of persons. Little did the member of the Conventionfrom the Free State imagine under the mask of this concession."—JOHN QUINCY ADAMS. OHN UINCY DAMS.
