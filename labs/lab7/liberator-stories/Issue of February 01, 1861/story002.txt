On Thursday, January 24th, at 10 A.M.,accordingappointment, the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Societymet at the Tremont Temple. At this hour, thehouse was nearly full with as quiet and orderly an as could be desired, very many of whom were. There was scarcely an indication of the riotousproceedings which followed. But at 11 1/2 o'clock,the gallery at the rear of the hall had become denselyfilled with a noisy and vulgar crowd, others of whompressed in at the corner doors beneath the gallery, tothe great inconvenience of those sitting there. Theyinterrupted the speaker by groans and howls from timeto time, giving occasionally three cheers for the Union,a way of variety.   FRANCIS JACKSON, the President, called the meetingto order. Rev.

DEAR COADJUTOR: For the last eighteen days, I have been a prisoner at, enfeebled by a fever of a low, typhoidal tendency;and though I am mending slowly, I am still not sufficiently to justify me, as a matter of common prudence, in present at our annual State gathering to-day. "The is willing," and restless for liberation, "but the fleshis weak."  I believe this will be the first of the long seriesof anniversaries held by the Massachusetts Anti-SlaverySociety, which I have failed to attend—held "through report" and "much tribulation"—in storm and —in the midst of impending violence, or with undisturbedcomposure—but always held hopefully, serenely,triumphantly.  It is a great cross to me to break the at this crisis; especially as, judging from "the of the Adversary," to-day, will be themost encouraging and the most potential ever held by theSociety, whether broken up by lawless violence, or permittedto proceed without molestation. The cause we advocatebeing not ours, but God's—not ours, but human nature's—appealing to all that is just, humane, noble andtrue, and upheld by an omnipotent arm—it is beyond all, unconquerable and immortal; "therefore will notwe fear, though the earth be removed, and though themountains be carried into the midst of the sea."          May a Divine patience, firmness, and spirit of peace be to all the friends of impartial freedom who maybe present at the meeting to-day, not returning railing forrailing, but looking calmly and joyfully to the end of this conflict with the powers of darkness—namely,the liberation of every bondman on the American soil, andthenceforward the commencement of an era of universalreconciliation, happiness and prosperity, such, as the worldhas never yet witnessed.   Yours, to break every yoke, WM. LLOYD GARRISON. EDMUND QUINCY, Esq. DMUND UINCY On motion of Mr. QUINCY, it was voted that thisletter be printed with the proceedings of the meeting. UINCY WENDELL PHILLIPS, Esq., made a partial report inbehalf of the Business Committee, presenting, fromthem, the following resolutions:— ENDELL HILLIPS 1. Resolved, Thai (to quote the language of DanielWebster) "the Anti-Slavery question has not only attractedattention as a question of polities, but it has strucka far deeper chord. It has arrested the religious feelingof the country; it has taken strong bold of the consciencesof men. He is a rash man indeed, little conversant withhuman nature, and specially has he a very erroneous estimateof the character of the people of this country, whosupposes that a feeling of this kind is to be trifled with ordespised. It will assuredly cause itself to be respected. Itmay be reasoned with; . . . but, to coerce it into silence—to endeavor to restrain its free expression—to seek to compressand confine it, warm as it is, and more heated as suchendeavors would inevitably render it—should all this beattempted, there is nothing in the Constitution, or in theUnion itself, which would not be endangered by the explosionwhich might follow." 2. Resolved, That (to quote the language of WilliamEllery Channing) "whoever injures a man, binds all mento remonstrate, especially when the Injured is too weak tospeak in his own behalf. The great bond of humanity isthe last to be dissolved. . . It is important that we should,each of us, bear our conscientious testimony against slavery,not only to swell that tide of public opinion which is tosweep it away, but that we may save ourselves from sinkinginto silent, unsuspected acquiescence in the evil." 3. Resolved, That (again to quote the language of the lamentedChanning) "communities are without excuse inaiding other States in binding on men an unrighteousyoke. On this subject, our fathers, in framing the Constitution,swerved from the right. We, their children, at theend of half a century, see the path of duty more clearlythan they, and must walk in it. . . The Free States oughtto say to the South, 'On you the whole responsibility ofslavery must fall. We wash our bands of it wholly. Wecannot, directly or indirectly, become accessories to thiswrong. We cannot become jailers, or a patrol, or a watch,to keep your slaves under the yoke. You must guardthem yourselves. If they escape, we cannot send themback. Our soil makes whoever touches it free. Yon mustguard your own frontier. In case of insurrection, we cannotcome to you, save at friends alike of bond and free.On this point yon are foreign communities. You haveoften said that you need not our protection, and we musttake you at your word.'" 4. Resolved, That (to quote the language of the Representativesof the District of District, Georgia, in the firstAmerican Congress,) "to show the world that we are notinfluenced by any contracted or interested motives, but ageneral philanthropy for ALL MANKIND, of whatever climate,language, or complexion, we hereby declare oar disapprobationand abhorrence of the unnatural practice ofslavery in America, (however the uncultivated state of ourcountry, or other specious arguments, may plead for it)—a practice founded in injustice and cruelty, and highly dangerousto our liberties, as well as lives—debasing part of ourfellow-creatures below men, and corrupting the virtue andmorals of the rest, and is laying the basis of that libertywe contend for, (and which we pray the Almighty to continueto the latest posterity,)upon a very wrong foundation." highly dangerousto our liberties, as well as lives 5. Resolved, That (to quote the language of HenryClay) 'those who would repress all tendencies towards libertyand ultimate emancipation, must do more than putdown the benevolent efforts of this Society. They must goback to the era of our liberty and independence, and inutilethe cannon which thunders its annual joyous return.They must revive the slave trade, with all its train ofatrocities. They must blow out the moral lights aroundus, and extinguish the greatest torch of all, which Americapresents to a benighted world, pointing the way to theirrights, their liberties, and their happiness. They mustpenetrate the human soul, and eradicate the light of reasonand the love of liberty. Then, and not till then, whenuniversal darkness and despair prevail, can you perpetuateslavery, and repress all sympathies and all humane and benevolentefforts among freemen, in behalf of the unhappyportions of our race who are doomed to bondage." Whereas, it is the 1st Article of the Constitution of Massachusetts,that "ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL,and have certain natural, essential and inalienable rights;among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying anddefending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessingand protecting property; in fine, that of seekingand obtaining their safety and happiness "; and LL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL Whereas, in support of this declaration, the people ofMassachusetts require of their Senators and Representatives,and judicial and other public servants, to make solemnoath or affirmation; thus virtually binding themselves bythe same adjuration, and to the same end; and Whereas, all the abolitionism ever advocated by theAmerican Anti-Slavery Society, or any of its auxiliaries, Iscomprehensively embodied in this 1st Article of the Constitutionof Massachusetts; therefore, 6. Resolved, That the people of this Commonwealth cannotreject or assail the Anti-Slavery movement, with referenceeither to its principles or aims, without repudiatingtheir own Bill of Rights, subverting the foundations oftheir own State government, trampling upon their ownheaven-attested doctrines, and covering themselves with theguilt of moral perjury. The reading of the resolutions elicited frequentcheers. The President, FRANCIS JACKSON, said that thequestion was now on Die adoption of these resolutions,and that the platform wan open to any one who desiredto speak, for or against them. The rule of the Societywas free discussion, and he requested any one whowished to speak to come forward to the platform. RANCIS ACKSON Rev. JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE, pastor of the Churchof the Disciples, was the first speaker. He said:— AMES REEMAN LARKE They, being dead, yet speak! I am glad to hear aspeech from Dr. Channing here this morning. I amglad to hear Daniel Webster speak, as he spoke whenhe was in his best estate. I am glad to hear HenryClay speak here to-day, as Henry Clay spoke when inhis youth, when be loved freedom, and when his heartbeat high in behalf of human liberty. They aregone; we remain. We are to finish their work. Weare here to be faithful to their ideas. What is lifeworth, what is it good for, if it is not to see to truth,and to uphold some principle of truth, justice andhonor? We come here to-day, friends, because the timesare dark, and because, in these dark times, men aretrying to make them darker by shutting out the eternallights which come from God's heavens. (Applause.)Because they would substitute for these everlastinglights of justice to all and freedom for all,sine base, earth-born, swamp-created meteors of mereexpediency—which is not expediency, even for thepresent hour. (Applause.) I have come here to-day,not hoping to be able to add a word to what all of you,oil veterans in the cause of freedom, know already;but I come to give my simple witness in defence ofthose everlasting principles. 1 do not want to hearany thing new here to-day. I want to hear the samegreat truths, which you have been uttering now fortwenty-five years, uttered over again to day in thishall. (Applause.) not When I was asked, some time since, to attend themeeting in commemoration of the work of JohnBrown, (applause and hisses,) though I reverencedJohn Brown (renewed cheers and hisses) though Ibelieved him to be, perhaps, the noblest man whichthis country has produced, (vehement hisses and loudapplause,) a man in whom truth and justice were incarnated,(a voice—"Amen"—applause and hisses)—so that we beheld them in visible form before oureyes, yet I did not come, and I did not wish to come.I did not think it well to hold that meeting. (Applause.)I did not think it desirable at that time. Isaid "No; I had rather not attend;" and I did notcome. But if I had known what was to happen herethat day, I certainly would not have stayed away.—(Loud applause and some hissing.) If I had supposedfor a moment, that an attempt was to be made, here inBoston, to put down any honest expression of opinion,upon that or upon any other subject, in a meeting ofthat kind, certainly I never would have hesitated, fora moment, to come here, and stand with those menon this platform. (Cheers and hisses.) Whateverelse we can spare here in New England, we cannot dowithout free speech. (Loud applause.) That lies atthe foundation of all our rights—of every thing thatis worth having in the land. He who strikes a blowat Wendell Phillips, strikes a blew at the State ofMassachusetts. [Tremendous applause, with some hissing, wasthe response to this declaration. Some one here calledfor three cheers for Mr. Phillips, which were givenwith great heartiness, the opposition in the galleryresponding with a few feeble groans.] Mr. Clarke continued—Whoever attempts to interferewith freedom of speech here in Massachusetts,spits in the face of the mother who bore him.—Whence comes all your prosperity, but from that divineprinciple which has been won for us all by thestruggles and the martyrdoms of the ages? [Thedisturbance in the gallery here becoming uproarious,Mr. Clarke paused for a moment; and then said]—Don't mind them. If they want to make a noise, letthem! It reminds me of a story I have heard of awoman who was beating her husband, and when somebodyasked him if he was not ashamed to let his wifebeat him, the man said—"O no! it amuses her, and itdon't hurt me." (Laughter.) So, if they want to make anoise, let them do so, till they are tired. Freedom ofspeech, we all believe in, except when somebody wantsto speak who has something to say which is not popular,and then we don't want to hear it. But what isfreedom of speech worth when what I have to say ispopular, when everybody is willing that I shouldspeak? The only time that we are bound to stand upfor freedom of speech is when those who want tospeak are unpopular. Then noble-hearted men say,"They shall speak; they must speak; our rightsare involved in their speaking; the rights of man areinvolved in their speaking." (Applause and hisses.)The only real difference between Massachusetts andAustria, is that in Massachusetts we can open ourmouths and speak, and in Austria they cannot. Thatis the real, fundamental difference between Massachusettsand Austria. I remember that when I was onthe Lago di Maggiore, I was talking with the boatmanwho was rowing me—a noble-looking fellow—anApollo-sort of a man—about the two sides of thelake—the Austrian side, Lombardy, and the Piedmonteseside, Sardinia; and I said to him, "You row onboth sides—which side do you like best, the Lombardyside or the Sardinian?" "O," said he, "I likethe Sardinian side much the best." "Why?" "Because,"said he, with his natural Italian language ofillustration, "because there in Sardinia my mouth isopen—so; but there in Lombardy it is shut—so."That is the difference. When you pass out of thoseStates of Europe where liberty is repressed, wherethe newspapers are not allowed to utter their convictions,where there is no freedom of speech, and crossthe line into Belgium or into Sardinia, you find atonce an entirely different state of things—everythingthen is prosperous and progressive. Why, John Milton,and Locke, and Algernon Sidney, have built upthe prosperity of Massachusetts by putting the foundationsunder her cotton mills—have made all her littlevillages ring with the joy of triumphal and successfulindustry and the conquests of man over nature, becausethey convinced the Anglo-Saxon race that themouth of a man ought to be open, even when he isdefending unpopular truth. That is the basis of allour prosperity; and therefore I am here to-day, becauseto-day we are told that Anti-Slavery is unpopular;and when my friends said to me, "You had betternot go there to-day," I replied, "Why not?""Why," said they, "is not this a wrong time, is notthis a bad time, to hold a meeting of that sort?"(Applause and hisses.) "Why so? Because peoplewish to put it down, therefore it is the right time tohold it. What is the use of contending for freedomwhen nobody opposes its exercise! When its exerciseis opposed, then is the right time to stand up forit." (Applause.) so. to-day This Anti-Slavery Society is not doing a new thingin maintaining freedom of speech. On this platform,for twenty-five years, the slaveholder has been just asfree to defend slavery as the Abolitionists have beento oppose it. [The rowdies in the gallery here set up a shout of"All up!" and gave three cheers for the Union, forMayor Wightman, and any thing else that occurredto them. The well-disposed portion of the audiencealso rose, to see what was going on, when Mr. Hinton,mounting a chair on the platform, said—"Let all thefriends of freedom keep their seats. Don't stir fromyour seats at any rate." This request was compliedwith, and when the noisy rabble had become somewhatquieted, Mr. Clarke proceeded.] If there is any man in this assembly to-day whothinks that slavery is a good thing, he ought to bethe man to protect the right of free speech here; forthis u the place where, for twenty-five years, hisopinion has had a chance to be uttered and defended.I come here to-day for that—because this is the placewhere freedom of speech in Massachusetts is to bedefended; and I say, as I once heard Mr. Manning ofthe Old South Church say, when he went to a meetingof this sort, to which, he said, his friends had advisedhim not to go, "Yes," he said, "I will go; forthough my gun is a small one, and doesn't make muchnoise, I don't want to hare it spiked." (Laughterand cheers.) Then, again, I come here because this is the onlyplace where any thing is said in behalf of four millionsof my countrymen who are in bondage.[Cries in thegallery, "Down with the niggers," and groans forJohn A. Andrew.]This is the only place where anythought is given to God's children who are marked witha darker color than ours. We hear everything elsediscussed—all other rights considered. Everythingthat belongs to the interests of the white man is talkedof every where else; bat where, except on this platform,does any one remember the four millions ofslaves? Why, if you ask me what is to be the resultof the present state of things in this country, I willgive you the answer I beard the other night. "It dependsupon who God cares for the most at the presenttime; whether God is thinking most of the white manor the negro." If God is caring to-day for the negroin the United States more than for the white man, thenI believe that disunion is to be the result, because disunionis to be the emancipation of the slave.(Loudapplause and hisses.) But I believe the South areright in a good many things that they say. I do notcome here as one who hates the South, or who hatesthe slaveholder. We are told that because we loveliberty, therefore we hate the slaveholder. (Noise inthe gallery.) We do not hate the slaveholder. Becausewe hate the evil that a man is doing, does it followthat we hate him? Because we hate the wickednessof a man, does it follow that we hate the man?I know very well that if Northern men had beenplaced under the same circumstances that Southernersare, they would have been very much the same kindof people, and done very much the same kind ofthings. If you or I had been born in Sooth Carolina,we should, very likely, have been mad to-day for secession,in order to prevent slavery being put down.We do not, therefore, hate them, because they aremade what they are by the circumstances around them;we pity them. But I say that we at the North, whohave been educated under other circumstances, andtaught to love freedom and justice for all, are bound,for the sake of the slaveholders themselves, never togive up those principles of justice and freedom, but tomaintain them, and maintain them more and more, tothe end. (Applause.) It is not merely for our ownsakes, or for the sake of the slave, that we are holdingthese meetings, but it is for the sake of the slaveholdertoo. He is a bum who is crushed down by his iniquitoussystem, and in order to help him, we muststand op for justice and liberty. (Cheers.) Thereare tens of thousands of Southern men, born andraised in the South, educated in the South, slaveholders,perhaps, themselves, who do not love slavery,who know its evils, and know them better than we do,because they have felt them longer and more closely.When the Anti-Slavery sentiment of the North is loweredone jot, they mourn. They say, "Stand up firmto your principles at the North, for your principles areour only reliance." They feel the need of us, theyfeel the need of the Anti-Slavery sentiment; and it isfor the sake of those thousands and tens of thousandsof men and women at the South, who feel the need ofthe protecting, increasing, magnetic sentiment offreedom, that we hold these meetings, as well as forthe slaves themselves. (Applause.) Friends, we are looking forward to a probable separation,or secession, of the Sooth from the North.The time seems to be harrying on that result forwhich this Society has contended for many years—Disunion. When that result comes, when it shall besettled that the shareholding States are to go by themselves,and the fifteen free States of the North, withthe addition of our sister Kansas, another free State,are to go by themselves, what is to be the consequence?You say, "Civil war." Civil war! Civilwar may come—we cannot tell what may come. Civilwar may come; but it seems to me that these fifteenmagnificent free States, this grand new Union, whichis to rise as the eagle soars from the earth toward thesky—this Union, composed of fifteen States, on whosesoil there is not the foot at a slave, united together bycommon convictions, common principles, and commoninterests—it seems to me that it will be so strong thatno nation will venture to attack it, and so just that itwill not attack any other. (Applause and hissing.) Isee no danger, except from concession—except fromyielding up our principles. I, far one, am ready tosay to the Southern States, "Go in peace!" I amready to say, "Take, if you choose, all the nationalproperty in your domain; take the forts; take thearsenals; take Washington, too, if you choose—lakeall; but let as stand together, a united, free nation ofindependent States, without slavery. (Hisses.) We cangive you everything but our freedom and our rights." I have said all I intended to say, and I will not detainthis meeting any longer this morning. (Load applause.) Mr. PHILLIPS then took the platform, and wasgreeted with a prolonged and enthusiastic shout ofwelcome, which testified not alone to the hearty sympathyof the audience, but to the fact, that an overwhelmingmajority of those present were loyal to theright The rowdies in the gallery cried out, "Allup!" and biased and groaned to the extent of theirpower, bat the feeble noise was speedily drowned inanother storm of applause. Mr. P. said:— HILLIPS Mr. CHAIRMAN,—I had hoped to address this meetingat a later hour, and that some other friends wouldhave taken the centre of the morning; but in consequenceof their occupation elsewhere, I shall troubleyou now, and leave them the latter part of the sectionI am worry that ear aeries of resolutions, necessarilyimperfect at this time, deal only in general principle,rustling to the maw. At a subsequent session,we hope to lay before you tome resolutions distinctlyreferring to the principle and method of this Society;for, after all, this is a meeting of the MassachusettsAnti-Slavery Society to-day—a body whose thirtyyears of history have settled in place and influenceupon Massachusetts. HAIRMAN [At this point, Mr. Phillips was interrupted by theturbulent spirits in the gallery with cheers for "Wightman,""Bell and Everett," "Clay," groans, hisses,cat-calls, "all up," yells, and all sorts of "sounds infernal."For fifteen minutes or more, this scene continued,Mr. P. uttering a sentence, now and then, ina lull, which even then, however, was not audible beyonda few feet from the speaker. Of coarse, anythinglike a connected speech was impossible, undersuck circumstances. We give the sentences as theyfell from his lips.] Mr. President, we stand to-day with the countryitself, as far down as Mason and Dixon's line, one-halfconverted to the maxims of this Society. (After along pause] The devil always goes out of a man ingreat wrath. (Laughter.) I remember once, ten yearsago, in Faneuit Hall, when we stood on the platformfor two hours, and did not utter a word—and it wasthe best meeting we ever held. (Applause by thosewho could hear.) Conceited as we are thought to be,no man on this platform can make a speech equal tothat—(pointing to the gallery] (Applause.) But thereis a better speech even than that to-day. South Carolinaspeaks for us (applause): and our argument onthis question is poor and vepil, in comparison withhers. For, after all, the question is not free speech.You and I shall live and outlive that many years. Myfree speech will take care of itself, or I will take careof it. (Applause.) We come here to-day to let Washingtonsee what Boston thinks of this crisis, andwe want her to declare that. Constitution or no Constitution,Union or no Union, against the law or withit, the Southern States, so long as they be slave States,shall be shovelled out of this Union. (Loud applauseand hisses.) We not only accept the crisis, but thankGod that it has come so soon. (Applause and hisses.)I am sorry for every merchant whose ledger balanceson the wrong side. I am sorry for every laborer whohas lost a week's or a months wages; and if his DanielWebster, and his Caleb Cashing, and his EdwardEverett, had listened to us thirty years ago, this troublenever had come on the country. [A voice—"Never!" and applause. Then the gallery screameditself hoarse for Webster and Everett, and other idolsof their worship] State Street may thank her ownidol, if she k bankrupt to-day. [More cheering forWebster, for the Union, and cries of "put him out,"interspersed with whistling and singing.] O, Mr.Chairman, we have plenty of time! We have thissession, this afternoon and evening, and three tomorrow.No occasion to hurry, in the least! SouthCarolina is waiting to hear from us. (Cheers for SouthCarolina.) The Southern States say that when theyhave organized their confederacy, they mean to leaveNew England out in the cold. Well, we shall be gladto be there. I am only sorry that my friends there(pointing to the rioters) arc oat in the cold. Now,ladles and gentlemen, this is a very momentous question— (Here the reprobates in the gallery struck up thesong— "We are going home,We are going home,We are going home,To die no more"—    which gratifying declaration they repeated, again andagain, but did not go. Instead of that, they struckup another equally interesting lyric, which, as newas we could make out, ran in this wise— "Tell John Andrew,Tell John Andrew,Tell John Andrew,John Drowns dead."    Then these model patriots and lovers of the Union gavethree greens for General Scott, and amused themselveswith imitating the sounds of the barn-yard, andthe cries of the street. At length, Mr. Phillips wasenable to speak again.] This k the largest anti-slavery meeting, said he, atten o'clock in the morning, that I ever saw in the cityof Boston. Six weeks ago, a hundred men came here,and found as so small as to be able to turn us out ofoar seats. To-day, at least, we have possession oftaxi platform and the hall. (Applause.) Now the questionis between yon and she men on the outside whichshall represent the Capital of Massachusetts. I havea little pride in Boston. I would rather that weshould keep in our own hands the appointment of ourown police. I hope we shall behave ourselves well today,and show that we are worthy of It; for if we donot, there k a parcel of country folks up there on thehill who will make as behave ourselves. (Applause.)Although I love Boston very well, I tore Massachusettsbetter—because she k bigger (laughter and applause);and therefore I mean to stand here to-day,and endeavor, so far as in me lies, to show the pressand the Commonwealth that the majority is on oursate. (Applause.) That, in spite of a few boys, Bostonis a decorous and well-behaved community. Ithink we shall prove k in the end. (Cheers by therowdies, and general uproar among them.) I thinkthat our twenty-seven, eight or nine annual meetingshave been wonderfully successfully in remodeling thepublic mind, and my proof of it is this very meetingsto-day. We are thus assailed, not because we arefew, not because we are uninfluntial, not because weare unheeded, but because we are feared. Take it as acompliment (Applause and hisses.) Nepoless'smaxim was, to charge on the centre at the boat Well,the charge has been, for the last six weeks, on theanti-slavery body of Boston. (Applause.) All wehave to do k to sea to it that we hold the banner asand say that be dad not see it. I can remember whena leading Republican holding the third offer in theGovernment, spoke to the merchants of Philadelphia,and the next day asked to he carried to the Anti SlaveryRooms "Why!" was the question "Toknow their opinion of say speech" "Bat," was thereply, "you had thousands to hear you; they are onlya few hundred" "True," he said; "but what theythink so-day, you'll think two years hence." (Mr. Phillips here took off his overcoat amid thecheers of his friends, and laid it one side, remarking—"I may have to stand here a good while, so I willtake my coat off."] We want to teach some doubting souls which waythe vanes act here in Massachusetts. Mr. Adamsdoes not seem to know whether they point North orSouth;—we want to show him that we are not onlyunwilling that Massachusetts should be a slave toState Street, but that we won't give up one inch ofterritory, five hundred miles west of the Mississippi,to the demands of the South. I would not give slaverya spoonful of earth to stay in the Union—noone; not a blade of grass, nor relinquish a single principle.(Uproarious singing.) That is the death-knell ofslavery—don't you hear it? (Applause.) [The volunteerchoir in the gallery again struck up, "We aregoing home," &C] That is the maniac, singing in hischains. (Loud applause.) It is necessary we shouldunderstand the state of things among different classesof people. I don't feel very proud of those representativesof Boston up there; still, I think things arenot near so bad as they were on the 3d of December.Then Mr. Fay and Mr. Howe came here in person;they only send their boys here to-day. (Loud laughter,the "boys" yelling and screaming to the imminentdanger of their lungs.) O, I forget, continuedMr. P.; I beg your pardon. We should have hadthem here to-day, but they started for Washington yesterdaywith the petition, and so the mob has lost itsaders, and don't know where to go. (Laughter.) Mr. Chairman, I have something to say, when Ican get out more than one sentence at a time; but adisconnected speech cannot have much argument in. I do not know but we may as well resolve ourselvesinto a Quaker meeting, and sit here in silence,is the representatives of Massachusetts. For, friendswill tell you a secret;—we are going to decide todaywhether this peninsula is still to be called Boston,or had better be named Wightmanville. (Laughterand applause, the "roughs" in the back part of theall cheering for Whightman.)  Wightmanville. Mr. QUINCY, (to whom Mr. Jackson had resignedthe chair,)—The orderly persons and members of theSociety are requested to take their acts, as a measureor order. These lads in the gallery have come hereto enjoy a holiday. No demist, they are glad to be released,after sweeping out their masters' stores, income here and make a noise. They are harmlesslads; and I think while we are waiting for the "goodtime coming," the friends had better take their sents,and remain patiently and quietly, and by and by, weshall hear the end of Mr. Phillip's speech. UINCY Mr. Phillips paused for some time, the rictous portionof the assembly keeping up their noisy demonstrations,cheering for the Union, for Criemondem, andothers, and calling out "Go ahead," "Sit down,""Blow your horn," &C, &C Mr. PHILLIPS. I just new heard three cheers forthe Union. I think the dead ought to be allowed torest. (Hisses and howls from the gallery.) I havealways found that the best abolitionists were thosewho come as boys to break up an anti-slavery meeting.I except to live five years, and to be cheered tothe echo by those very boys, when they have grownolder and wiser. (Applause, hisses and groans.) Why,they will carry enough away from the anti-slaverymeeting to-day to convert them. Yes, even the scenein yonder gallery will convert them. Massachusettshave not get in her bosom the materials for mobs.This is nothing but the spasm of a momentary irritation—it will not last. Our fathers left us commonschools— HILLIPS. [Here an amateur whistler struck up "yanhonDoodle," and the musical entertainment was extendedby one more singing of the already familiar words,"We are going home," &C] Mr. PHILLIPS. This is the "irrepressible conflict"betwixt the floor and the gallery. I wish Mr. Everetthad taken his mob with him. (Cheers for the Union.)Poor Union! (Three groans for Phillips.) It does notmatter whether these men are successful or not. Weknow our own principles. We know the discussionwhich have brought about this result. No matterwhat mobs may endeavor to do; they cannot killideas. So long as honest men think, so long will theideas we have uttered pervade eastern Massachusetts.It is no matter whether we number two hundred, onehundred, or fifty. They very meting of this body,in defence of all the wealth of the city, is a victory.The mob cannot shut us out of this hall, though theymay be able to conquer our voices. If we cannot liveby law, we cannot live at all. This question is notone of argument, or eloquence, or words; with StateStreet, it is a mere question of dollars. But SouthCarolina knows that, in the long run, dollars do notrule in this country, but ideas rule. You know verywell that Daniel Webster represented the dollars ofMassachusetts. Edward Everett, to-day, representsthe dollars of Massachusetts. He can be endorsed byevery bank president and by every manufacturingcorporation in Massachusetts; but they are not able toturn Charles Sumner out of his seat. (Applause.)They may make money, but they cannot make publicopinion; wealth is not the fountain of public thought. HILLIPS. [Here Mr. Phillips addressed himself for some time,in a moderate tone, to the reporters and friends immediatelyround him—a proceeding which seemed toprovoke the rowdies at a distance to a curious science.] Abolitionists, look here! Friends of the slave, lookhere! These pencils [pointing to the reporters] willdo more to create opinion than a hundred thousandmobs. While I speak to those pencils, I speak to amillion of men. What, then, are those boys? (Applause.)We have got the press of the country inour hands. Whether they like us or not, they knowthat our speeches sell their papers. (Applause andlaughter.) With five newspapers we may defy fivehundred boys. Therefore, just allow me to make myspeech to those gentlemen in front of me, and I canspike all those cannon. (Applause.) Why, if I shouldwrite out my speech, and give it to the Atlas and Bee.I need only stand and laugh at yonder noises. Myvoice is beaten by theirs, but they cannot beat types.All hail, and glory to Faust, who invented printingfor he made make impossible! (Applause.) I appealfrom the stadies of Boston to the press of the Commonwealth.These boys have got a holiday. Let usbe glad their masters gave it to them. They onlymistook the place to come to. The Common is theplace for Election Day, not Tremont Temple. Butwhat we want to send out to the country is the fact.You know that when the Billingsgate fish-women ofParis came into the galleries of the National Convention,they simply resolved that they were in perpetualsession. Well, white newspapers are printed, so arewe. Now, those fellows cannot last but one morning,while the Abolitionists can talk till doomsday Theyhave an unending gift of free speech. (Groans for theAbolitionists.) Those boys have been singing, "Weare going home," for some time; and if our speechesare so unpalatable and vituperative, I wonder they donot go. The doors are all open. But after all, friends,let us rejoice in this hour. Twenty flee year ago,half in whispers, with bated breath, in halls thatwould hold two hundred people, we cried DISUNION;and to-day, the Rocky Mountains bring back the echo,and thirty States are sundered in the effort to free theslave. (Loud cheers.) We debated, thirty years ago,Whether we could raise ten thousand dollars in orderto print anti-slavery tracts; now, the Charleston Mercuryand the Louisville Journal print them for us.(Applause.) Poor fellows! (Pointing to the rioters,]they have no organ—we have conquered the NewYork Herald. Atlas and Bee.  ISUNION Mercury Journal Herald. They say one man is a majority, when he has righton his side; I have got three thousand on my side.—(Tumult in the gallery, during which Mr. Phillipspaused, and then said]—Do not be impatient, ladiesand gentlemen, it is only ten minutes to twelve; thereis time enough. Time will do every thing. It willbring South Carolina back into the Union a free State.(Applause.) We are not going to lose one of the oldthirteen. We are going to conquer them all to freedom.I mean, before I die, to have all the thirteenStates in the Union, without a have. (Applause.)—My disunion means simply to get rid of the slaveholders.I want the son of every black man whofought with Washington inside my Union, and I knowthat the 384,000 blacks of South Carolina are the sonsof the Revolution. The stars and stripes shall yetprotect them in liberty. (Applause.) Only wait; weshall worry out these boys. This is Boston; we willappeal to the Commonwealth in a moment or two;that is a very different scene. I understand the Statehouse has begun to move, and got as far as half waydown Park street; and when the codfish comes, lookout, for we shall have quiet. Ense petit placidom sublibertate quietem. That means—Free Speech. (Applause.)We will have it yet Massachusetts is notconquered; the Capitol is not owned by State street,(cheers,) and whoever is Mayor of Boston, John A.Andrew is Governor of the Commonwealth. (Prolongedcheers.) I do not despair of the Commonwealth. Ense petit placidom sublibertate quietem. (Three groans were given for Gov. Andrew, by thecrowd in the gallery, which were followed by threecheers for Mayor Wightman. Then some one calledout, "Three cheers for Wendell Phillips," which weregiven with an emphasis.] Mr. PHILLIPS. An Abolitionist is a happy man, tohave such a cheer as that, and a mob besides. (Laughterand applause.) I hope all my blessings won'tcome at once. HILLIPS. A VOICE. "Go ahead! we've got them where thehair is abort." This remark called forth uproariouslaughter from both sides. OICE. Mr. PHILLIPS resumed—O, we have been througha great many such scenes as this. There is always acalm after a storm. You will find after this, that everyRepresentative from Massachusetts on the floor ofCongress will stand so straight that he will lean backward.(Applause and hisses.) I am told that CharlesSumner said, a fortnight ago, that he had more relianceon South Carolina than on Massachusetts tohelp us in this crisis. (Applause by the mob.) Hewill rejoice when the Commonwealth comes down likea vulture, and sweeps that gallery where it belongs—into the calaboose. (Applause, groans for CharlesSumner, and hearty cheers.) Well, friends, we oughtto be very generous. The conquerors should allowthe conquered to complain as much as they please.When, twenty years ago, we began our labors, EdwardEverett was at the top of the ladder. To-day,this Society, after twenty years of argument, sendsCharles Sumner (biases) into the Senate, and EdwardEverett at the head of a Committee. (Cheers forEverett.) We have turned things upside down, andgot them right side up. [A Voice—"Why didn't yousend Burlingame?") To-day, Sumner representsMassachusetts, and Everett and Wintbrop—we havetaken them down from that elevation—they representthe Merchants' Exchange. (Applause.) HILLIPS Voice Now, gentlemen, allow me to make one exceedinglyserious and timely suggestion to you. It is more thanlikely, that within a short time, the civil authoritywill enter this hall; and allow me to suggest, in orderthat it may be known who are our friends and whoare not, that the friends of this platform will, as far aspossible, keep their seats, and preserve silence.—(Cries of "Good" and applause.) [This statement and request of Mr. Phillips had aninstantaneous effect on the mobocrats, who became almostentirely quiet, and remained so, with only occasionalinterruption, to the close of Mr. Phillips'sspeech.] Mr. PHILLIPS. And now, having secured a littletemporary quiet, suppose we go back to the considerationof the question which assembles this Society thismorning, which is, the abolition of American Slavery.There exists, as you know, ladles and gentlemen, inthis fragment of the Union,—several States havingquitted it,—the Gulf States having almost or entirelyparted, and only the border States and the MississippiSlates left to us—there exists, at this moment, throughoutthe North, the question, what mood of mind shallwe present ourselves in to our Southern brethren?How shall we let them understand the position of theNorth? Our delegates in Congress—those from NewEngland certainly—have done their duty like men.It is understood that the speech of Mr. Seward wasread to them a week before its delivery, and repudiated.(Cries of "Good," cheers, and hisses.) NewEngland said—"We wish no compromise—we willallow none. We have walked up to this spot by thetoil of a quarter of a century. We are ready to meetthe South on the broad question of abolition. Wesettle the question here. Either let it be laid out ofpolities, by the more territorial settlement, or we settlethe whole question on a broad basis." They arenot for any compromise whatever. Now, what messageshall Boston send to that faithful body of men?How shall we, who are not fettered by the responsibilitiesof party, who represent not party lines but theplastic public opinion outside of them—represent, notthe temporary moment, but the coming future—howshall we speak, at this hour, to the Union! I say it inno conceit, but in verity, and from sincere conviction,New England does the thinking for one-half of theUnion. We have sent our children to the valley ofthe Mississippi, and they look back to our codes andour great men for their models, for their examples.They took to our press, and largely to our pulpits, andentirely to our colleges, to stud them the best thoughtof the age. We hold the magnificent West, with itsunlimited wealth and its coming omnipotence, in ourright hand. "Westward the star of empire takes itsway." How shall it be wielded! Shall the slave restin silence, hopeful that from the conscience of theNorth will come the cause of his jubilee? It is for usat this hour to save the masters from the bloodiest insurrectionthat ever occurred. It is by standing ofthe Northern basis, and demanding that this source ofweakness and danger, that this national sin, that thisconvulsive element, which threatens to, or has alreadydismembered the Union, shall be treated like statesman.I have no word of censures for the great Senatorof New Tack, still less, a word even of doubt for theincoming President of Illinois. (Cheers and hisses.)I believe that, like an honorable man, he means tokeep, and has told his friends to say that he means tokeep in office the promises that were made for him inthe canvas; and while Abraham Lincoln lives,—andspies of the rage of she men South of Mason andDixon's line, he will live to be buried in the gratitudeof the North, twenty or forty years hence, (applause)—while he lives and dictates law to this country fromthe White House at Washington—as he will, on the5th day of March, and If It cannot be done otherwise,Illinois will cover every square foot of the Districtwith a living man and Republican (load appliance.)—while he lives, I have faith to believe that not oneblade of grass, not one atom of the soil of the territorieswill be poisoned by the footsteps of even thecompromise of a slave. So much this Society hasgained; and the rock which a third of a century hasroiled up the mountain height is not to ratable back atthe bidding of a mob. There it stands, anchored onthe votes of eighteen hundred thousand freemen, whosend Abraham Lincoln to Washington to do their bidding,and it will be done. (Applause.) This is noboy's play. The babies of Carolina are not to speakto the great Northwest. (Cheers.) They are to bequiet in their cradles, and we will see that they arerocked to sleep; and meantime, Northern care andforesight shall tuck them up nicely, so that they shallnot take cold.(Applause and laughter.) HILLIPS. Our fathers pledged (heir odious and hateful oathsto-their damnable conspiracy in 1787, that the slave ofthe Carolinas should be deprived of the right arm thatGod gave him in order to defend himself. They gluedto the scabbard the sword of insurrection, and therebythey made It tenfold my duty never to let my tonguerest from demanding justice for the man they had disarmed.I stand hero to-day by the sacrifice of a life,to atone, as far as possible, for the sins of my father,(applause and hisses,) and every man who loves hisfather is bound to be here to-day. (Applause.) [AVoice— "Three cheers for his father. "Another"Three cheers for the Union." Well, we are here,friends, to make those cheers deserved. We are hereto make the Union worthy of cheers within hearingof Fan veil Hall. (Appliance and cries of "Good.")We are here to wipe out the three-fifths slave basis,the slave clause of recapture, the pledge against insurrection,and every black stripe from the parchmentof 1789; and when we have done it, we will go downto that old Cradle of Liberty, and invoke Adams, andOtis, and Hancock to come and listen to our repentance,and to oar jubilee together. (Applause.) But itis here we are to perform the lustration. Every liebears bitter fruit No sin can be wiped out in anhour. The mistakes of a generation are not gotten ridof in a night?" Our fathers ate sour grapes, and ourteeth are set on edge." State Street managed and intrigued;she sent her representatives to get JohnHancock swathed in flannel, to make it possiblefor Massachusetts to adopt the Constitution of 1787.The free thought of Massachusetts rejected it. Themen from the country spit upon it. What were calledthe Democrats of that day trod it under their feetState Street—the men who made money by trade—went to Hancock, solemn and stately in his Beaconstreetmansion, and said to him— "We cannot savethis. The conscience of Massachusetts rejects it."And the old pet of the people put on his flannels, tookhis crutches, and came down with a compromise—(God curse all compromises!) and made Massachusettsa member of the Union.(Applause and hisses.) Another [A voice from the gallery— "God curse the man whosaid that! "] A voice from the gallery Mr. PHILLIPS. Well, it is natural that State Streetshould hang on to her child. It is natural that sheshould be fond of the pet that she cradled, and hasbrought up to this manhood. And it is natural, too,that short-sighted wealth, timid, shrinking from everychange, should imagine that if she gets rid of SouthCarolina, it writes bankruptcy on her ledger. But Imaintain that Massachusetts does not make moneymerely because South Carolina whips negroes. Imaintain that the brain of the Yankee can compel thetribute of the world, and the thrift and cunning of ourright hands can make us rich, spite of Virginia andthe Carolinas too. (Loud applause.) We are boundto prove that honest labor can stand on its own feet,without the help of the aristocracy of the white race,or the slaveholders of the Carolinas. (Renewed cheering.)Graduate of the free schools of Boston as I am,I am bound to prove, in the face of Europe, that"honesty is the best policy," and that America canprove it in the face of the world. (Applause.) I ambound to prove that it is possible to make a man'sbread here without stealing it; and I am certain that,with that great West, that populous Ohio, that magnificentNew York, to back us, and welcoming Canadainto our lap, we can still, even if the South leaves us,for a time, maintain a power to which the South willgravitate back gladly before you and I are old. Yes,those boys will hardly pass their majority, will hardlybe entitled to vote, before you will see Carolina comingback, to put her star on the national banner, and liveagain under the stripes. We are not going to be separated.The Mississippi binds us like a glorious ribbonof gold. We cannot be divided permanently. It isnothing but the poison of slavery that occasions thistemporary convulsion. The Sumters and the Marionsare ours. The Rutledges, the Lees, and the Pinckneys,where are they! Under the feet of some namelessrascals who are undertaking to-day to representSouth Carolina. Virginia has gone under, and thereis nothing but bubbles on the surface. We willdigdown under it, and find the ashes of PatrickHenry, and so call Virginia back to her duty. (Applause.)If it is necessary, as in the days of theCrusaders, we will take the dust of Washington fromhis tomb on Mount Vernon, and Everett shall followit, as we carry it through those fifteen States, andmake them, on their knees, be as good abolitionistsas he was.(Applause.) HILLIPS. No, we have not lost a country. These puny representativesare not Americans, that run to Washington,and beg South Carolina to see that they kneel inthe dirt. (Loud applause.) The history of the past,the grand school of the events of sixty years, havenot produced only such men in Massachusetts. Underfarmers' frocks, and standing beside spindles, and overthe blacksmith's anvil, and smelling the sweet soil ofthe ploughshare, there are yet descendants of PaulRevere and James Otis, who will save Massachusettsfrom the canker of her own gold. (Prolonged cheering.)I believe in the possibility of liberty, and Iwill never be convinced that sixty such years as wehave passed can create only a community of cowards.This Society will yet hold its sessions peacefully;every speech will be listened to; and when we go outfrom this ball on Friday night, we shall go out withthe thanks of Boston, for having redeemed it to decencyI(Loud and prolonged applause.) such DAVID LEE CMILD. "I propose throe cheers forthe conqueror." They were given. AVID EE MILD. The President then announced RALPN WALDOENERSON, of Concord, who was received with threevigorous cheers by the audience, followed by threecheers for the Union from the mob, and a successionof disturbing groans and outcries. Toward the doseof Mr. Phillips's speech, several policemen had enteredthe gallery, and their glazed caps were conspicuousamong the rioters. Rev. Mr. Waterston, in the midstof the tumult, rose and asked— "Will not the policedo their duty?" The appeal had no effect, however,and Mr. Emerson was obliged to wait some time beforehis voice could be heard. At length, when comparativesilence was obtained, he said:— ALPN ALDO NERSON MR. PRESIDENT,—It is little I have to say; but tofill up the interval between the gentleman who is aboutto follow me, and the organ of thought and opinionwho has just spoken, I will say, that I am very happyto ace this Society, through its organs here, assertingthose principles which belong to this soil, which belongto every person who now hears one (hisses); and I amglad that a Boston boy, educated here in our schools,here in our colleges, all his life spent among you, haskerned to find in your hearts as answer to every burningword he speaks. Why, ladies and gentlemen, Ifeel that really the Boston boys are all right. I am alittle proud of this village, Let me say to those youngforeigners, to those young strangers, that I was bornin the spot where the postdates now stands; that allmy education has been hi her town schools hare, heroin her collage, and all the best of my life spent here.That is true too, of gentleman— who presides here,and of Mr. Phillips, who has just addressed as. Ithink the same record cannot be shown by the youngpeople who have endeavored to interrupt this meeting. R. RESIDENT But I have to say, that one thing seems only tooplain, in the new history of the country, as well as inthe old. They say that the Asiatic cholera takes thevital principle out of the air by decomposing the air.I think it is the same with the moral pestilence underwhich the country has suffered so long; it actually decomposesmankind. This institution of slavery isbased on a crime at that fatal character that it decomposesmen. The barbarism which has lately appearedwherever that question has been touched, and in theaction of the States where it prevails, seems to stapifythe moral sense. The moral injury of slavery is infinitelygreater than its pecuniary and political injury.I really do not think the pecuniary mischief of slavery,which is always shown by statists, worthy to benamed in comparison with this power to subvert thereason of man, at that those who speak for it, who defendit, who act in its behalf, seem to have lost themoral sense. Here are young men from the Southerncountry, whom we have always supposed were in theminority, who had not spoken, but who would yet savetheir country—they also have been educated here inour institutions, have been educated in Europe, andwhen they have gone back, they nave suffered fromthis opthalmia, this blindness, which hides from themthe great facts of right and wrong. They do not perceivethe political, economical and moral mischief doneby the institution. I chanced, within a few days, to bereading the travels in Alabama of the English naturalist,Gosse, who has set all our boys making aquariums,and he recites precisely those facts which are deniedby our Southern friends—the burning of books andthe like, the utter suppression of all freedom of thoughtand conversation among friends. [Noise in the gallery,which obliged the speaker to pause.] I was going to say, that I hope that, in the greataction now pending, all the forbearance, all the discretionpossible, and yet all the firmness, shall be used bythe representatives of the North, and by the people athome. Gentlemen, friends, no man of patriotism, noman of natural sentiment, can undervalue the sacredUnion which we possess; but if it is sundered, it willbe because it bad already ceased to have a vital tension.The action of to-day is only the ultimatum of what hadalready occurred. The bonds had ceased to exist, becauseof this vital defect of slavery at the South actuallyseparating them in sympathy, in thought, incharacter, from the people of the North; and then, ifthe separation had gone thus far, what is the use of apretended tie? As to concessions, we have none tomake. The monstrous concession made at the formationof the Constitution is all that can ever be asked;it has blocked the civilization and humanity of thetimes up to this day. I cannot help thinking just now,in connection with some facts that were mentioned, ofa story of Mr. Wilson. You all know Prof. Wilson,the author of the "Noctes"—the wit of Edinboro' andLondon. When some gentlemen, strangers at thelake—[Noise in the gallery, hisses, groans, calls of"put him out," "dry up," "unbutton your coat," &C] Mr. EMERSON. I know you will hear my story: itis very good. One of Prof. Wilson's family had beeninsulted in a boat upon the lake. The fact was broughtto his knowledge, and he immediately prepared tohorse-whip the offenders. They learned to whosefamily the offended person belonged, and got a mutualfriend to go with them to the Professor's house, topropitiate him. He introduced them, and said, "Theseare the gentlemen who have, by some mistake, interferedwith your friend." Prof. Wilson heard theirapology coldly, and allowed them to depart. Whenthey had gone, his friend said, "Why, Professor, youshould have more magnanimity than to receive theirapology with such coolness." "Magnanimity!" saidhe; "was ever magnanimity more enormous thanmine? There they sat, and I did not pitch them outof the window!" (Laughter.) It seems to me thatis really a fair illustration at the immense concessionsthat have already been made, and we do not need anymore. MERSON. But I will not detain the company longer. THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON, of Worcester,the next speaker, was received with cheers, (withwhich some hisses from the gallery intermingled,)and spoke with less interruption than his predecessors,as follows:— HOMAS ENTWORTH IGGINSON Mr. CHAIRMAN—We art debtors to the disturbersof this meeting for several things. If it were possibleto add to the rhetorical triumphs of Wendell Phillips,they have given him an additional one this morning(applause); and if it were possible to show to Massachusettsthe calm, recluse philosopher, Ralph WaldoEmerson, in a still more noble aspect, this setting ofriot has completed the picture. (Renewed applause.)Even the bare threat of disturbance has promoted thisSociety out of the little Mercantile Hall, where it hasmet for the last few years, into Tremont Temple; andif the mere rumor of trilling danger has producedso much, what would the appeal of actual dangerdo among the anti-slavery men of Massachusetts?(Cheers.) It has done more than this. The PersonalLiberty Bill is pending in the State House. Howmany additional votes our friends in the galley harerolled up for us! (Applause and hisses.) How manymore will our opponents (whom the gods have mademad)—how many more will they give us, before thisConvention baa concluded its sessions? And thatother measure—the Metropolitan Police BUI for Boston(loud cheers, the rioters in the gallery revealing, incharacteristic manner, the terrors the bill has for them)—a measure which no one would have dared to suggest,and which I, for one, would have voted against,under ordinary circumstances,—here are a hundredmen in that gallery, to-day, who are working withall their heart and soul to pass that MetropolitanPolice Bill. (Loud cheers.) As Shakspeare says: HAIRMAN "This you that do it, not we. You do the deeds,And your unworthy deeds find us the words."  Here are we, anti-slavery speakers, tired of speaking.We had fallen away from the work. We hadbeen grossly remiss—I know I had, for one—in theselast anti-slavery meetings in Boston, for a few years,in not coming. We thought that so much of the battlehad been won that our voices, at least, might bespared. Your silence [pointing to the gallery] hadsilenced us; your noise calls us forth again. (Cheers.)It is one of the strongest objections I have to thisstate of things, that it has brought me here to-day, forone, to make a speech against my will. If speakingbecomes a crime, if speaking is to be put down bythe chaos at quadrupedal noises we have beard thismorning, the sooner wt all begin to talk, the better.(Applause.) Mr. Chairman, we are not here to-day to dig in theashes at the past; we are not here to-day even to contendfor the slave. The slave to-day must take careof himself, for the moment, while we are defendingthe right of the white men of Massachusetts to beheard in Boston. (Load applause.) I thank theserioters, who have placed us in a position so logicallyirresistible that we are sure of the verdict at last.Slavery or and-slavery may be right or wrong; FREESPEECH is right always and everywhere. (Prolongedcheering.) We have come back to a position whichis impregnable. They have driven as oat, it may be,for a moment, of the questionable Fort Moultrie ofour position; but it is only to fall back upon that FortSumter of human right, which, in Massachusetts, willnever again be captured. (Loud applause.) Neveragain! The day is past. Those who try to disturbit now, occupy a position as hopelessly far in the rearas possible. To say that it is behind this age is nothing—it is behind all ages—the attempt to pat downfree speech by mob law. Those who try it are tooold to be the grandfathers of the hunkers. The remotestancestors of hunkerism never dreamed of anythingmore idle than the effort to suppress it is themanner in which it is sought to be done to-day. Tocall it death is nothing—the position of hunkerismthat has been taken here. It is like that noblemen inEngland, who said, when he knew he had held hispublic office too long, and speaking of himself and anoctogenarian compser,—one of those "old public functionaries"who are not confined to this country,—"Why," said he, "Trelawney and I have been deadten years, only we won't acknowledge it." (Laughter.)The thing that all the wealth and power and administrativeenergy at Boston tried to do, when the anti slaveryparty numbered but a hundred, and failed todo it, it is now idle to attempt to do to-day, when, evenunder all the invitations given to the mob, a largemajority of the awaiting are the friends of free speech!(Applause, and cries of "Good.") This work of reinstatingourselves upon a platform undisturbed willnot last long. The battle has been fought and wonagain this morning, and it can never again be wagedunder such disadvantages to as, (Cheers.) It willnot last long, and then we can flail back noon oar legitimatework, which is, oar own rights at secured, to lookafter the rights of others; to seek, not to defend therights of the wealthy and influential, who can takecare of themselves, but of the poor and the outcast.Is there any man who is trampled on by the wholewhole community? There is the man for as to defend.Is there any man whom a whole dam of hisfellow-citizens seek to persecute,—who, in the nighttime, when defeated in their efforts to disturb peaceableassemblages of other men, unite in little companies,and go into corners, and down cellars, and intohorse-railroad cars, to drag out and glory In persecutingthe negro, because they do not dare to meet awhite man,—is there any class of men in Boston sodegraded as that, and any such more degraded classwho wish to persecute them, it is for them that wemust labor, and make their cause our own. It is becausethis Society has labored for them that all thismiserable hostility has been called forth to-day. It isbecause this Society has done its work in calling forthnot only the men who believe in Mr. Garrison's dogmaswholly, but men like those who have spoken herethis morning, who are not identified with him in hisviews of the Constitution, or with Mr. Phillips in his—it is because the Anti-Slavery Society, by the nobleliberality of its platform, has called such men upon it,that h is opposed and resisted; and, by the sametoken, it is for doing that, fur fighting the great battleof liberty for Massachusetts men, that this Anti SlaverySociety will become a blessed memory inMassachusetts, and this day a sacred day of triumphfor free speech henceforward and forever. (Loud applause.) all On motion of Henry C. Wright, the meeting adjournedto 8 o'clock, P.M. The noise in the galleries then ceased, the disturbersleaving the house with the others. A very largeDumber of these disorderly persons, however, remainedin the street before the Temple, using profane,boisterous and threatening language as the audiencedispersed, especially manifesting their hatetoward Mr. Phillips, against whom threats were freelymade. A hearse happening to go by at this time, onebrutal ruffian called out—"Hold on, and take WendellPhillip." Mr. Phillips, however, left the buildingby a private way, and the mob was thus deprived ofan opportunity to vent their malice in any other waythan by threats. The hall was crowded to overflowing before thehour for calling the meeting to order, and it soon became manifest that the disturbing element had receivedlarge accessions to its force. The Travellerdescribes the mixed character of the gathering inthis wise:— Traveller "As soon as the door were throws open, the crowd, comprehendingevery grade of polities, morality, and religionbelief in its ranks,—Breckinridgers, negroes, Douglasmen, Garrisonians, bell men, North streeters, Beaconstreeters, John brown's men, ministers of the Gospel, pickpockets,reporter, teamsters, dry goods jobbers, loafersbrokers, rum-sellers, ladies, thieves, gentlemen, State officers.boys, police-men— it is impossible to enumerate theelements of which this promiscuous throng was composed." "Outside, a number of people," continues the Traveller"as if too lair to enter, and too curious to go away, hoveredabout the door of the Temple, inspecting all who enteredwith as much, particularity as if they bad been all veritableNadgets, in the employ of genuine Anglo-BengaleeLife Insurance Companies. Traveller "One gentleman seemed anxious to enter, and stillvery reluctant to run the gauntlet of the curious eyesAt last, he spasmodically passed the threshold, and, turninground, took off is his, hat said— 'Gentlemen—I wish my presence here may net be misconstrued.I am neither an abolitionist, a rioter, nor apickpocket. I'm going in to see a man.' " (Silence, brokenby a slight tittering.) Just before three o'clock, a number of policemen enteredthe galleries, and were greeted with hisses bythe rowdies, who then gave three cheers for MayorWightman. The meeting was called to order at 8 o'clock by Mr.Quincy, who read a letter from FRANCIS JACKSONPresident of the Society, declining a re-election. Onmotion of Rev. Mr. Hodges, the letter was referred tothe Committee on the nomination of officers. RANCIS ACKSON CHARLES C. BURLENGHT was then introduced as thefirst speaker in the afternoon, and proceeded to addressthe assembly, speaking nearly an hour, in themidst of the wildest uproar, to which he paid no moreattention than if he were on the other side of theglobe, but spoke right on, with a logic as clear, aspirit as uncompromising, and illustrations as pertinentand forcible, as if be were addressing the mostquiet and attentive audience ever assembled beforehim. We are obliged to defer the report of his speedtill next week. HARLES URLENGHT By the time Mr. Burleigh had concluded, the lowerpart of the hall under the gallery was completely packedwith the mob, who cheered and hissed in one corner,and were lustily answered by cheers from the oppositecorner, which drowned the voice of the speaker.He sat down amidst applause and hisses. The President said he observed men in the audiencewith badges on their breasts. (Loud and longcontinued uproar, and repetition of singing for severalminutes, followed by clapping of hands and "tigers,"during which the President stood in silence, or consultedwith those about him.) The President again attempted to call upon the police,but his voice was fairly drowned by the noiseThe audience arose upon their feet, some trying toescape in their fright Cushions were taken from theseats in the gallery, and tumbled down upon theheads below in rapid succession, and were tossed aboutfrom place to place. The confusion and uproar wereindescribable. First, the mob would sing, thencheer, then hiss; then sway one way, and then theother; cushions and hats were thrown in the air, dogsbarking, cats mewing, &C &C, were imitated, and uproar reigned supreme. After a while, there was alull, and the Chairman then introduced Mr. Geo. HHOYT, of Athol, as one of John Brown's counsel. OYT This was the signal for a renewed outbreak of calls,and lasers, and hisses. which completely drownedMr. Hoyt's voice. Mr. QUINCY. I observe in the hall, scattered aboutin various conspicuous places, men with badges ontheir breasts. If the police have not been instructedby the Mayor to stand by and assist this mob by theirsilence and inactivity, they will do their duty. (Hisses,groans, derisive laughter, &C) UINCY. At length Mr. Hoyt attempted to speak, thoughthis voice must have been utterly inaudible sixfeet from where ha stood. The reporter wasdose to his elbow, but the confusion was so great,that the closest attention was required to understandwhat he said. I think, said Mr. Hoyt, that Mr. Garrison spoke thetruth when, a quarter of a century ago, he said, "Iam in earnest; I will not equivocate; I will not retreata single inch." Before the face of a Massachusettsmob, the Anti-Slavery Society says, "We arein earnest; we will not equivocate; we will not retreata single inch." (Tremondous uproar.) After a pause Mr. Hoyt said—It seems to be aquestion whether your voices or my legs will firstkick the beam,' (The mob sung "We are goinghome," &C) Mr. HOYT. You have been "going home" so long,it would be came for thankful if you would go atonce. OYT. It was now four o'clock, and the disturbance hadreached its culminating point. Scarcely a word couldhe heard that was uttered on the platform. Just then, amovement was noticed in one of aisles, and presentlyit was even that the Mayor, with the Chief of police,and a large posses of officers, was slowly forcing hisway to the platform. Arrived there, he stepped tothe centre, in front of the President, and said— Silence! SILENCE! SILENCE, in the galley!Fellow citizens—follow citizens—I am saw that you,who are the citizens of Boston, will listen to the voiceof its Chief Magistrate. [Gallery—"Good"—"good":"three cheers for Mayor Wightman."] Fellow-citizens,I can only say, that you will testify that respectfor the Chief Magistrate whom you have elected, bykeeping silence, and listening to that which I shallsay, [Gallery—"We will do it!" "Three cheers forMayor Wightman.] Silence Gallery Gallery THE MAYOR (in the imperative mood.) Silence!SILENCE! I am requested, inasmuch as this meetinghas been disturbed by tumultuous and riotous proceedings—I am requested by the Trustees of thisbuilding to disperse the meeting. [The rowdiesscreamed, "Good,"—"good," and cheered at the topof their lungs.) AYOR Silence Dea. GILBERT one of the Trustees, pressed forward,and exclaimed, " It is n't so. Will yon let mesee the letter!" The Mayor declined. ILBERT Mr. QUNICY. Will yon allow the agent of thebuilding, Ms. Hayes, to see it! We doubt its authenticity. UNICY. THE MAYOR. I will not, sir. I will settle that tomorrow,not now. [Tuning to the audience]—Fellow-citizens,baring thus announced my purpose, underthe written order of the Trustees, [Voices—"False,"—"False!"] "I have now simply to say toyou, that I am sure you will respect me enough toI leave this place quietly and peaceably. [" No,"—"Yes,"—"Read the letter."] HE AYOR. Voices The confusion, at this time, was indescribable—thatof the platform rivaling the gallery, for everybodycrowded forward to the desk, amid excited cries of"It's false! "—"It's a lie! "—"Read it!" &C Atlength the Mayor was forced, by the storm of dispute,to read the letter, which he did, first remarking—"Iam requested to read the document which has beenplaced in my hands, and I regard it as sufficientlyauthentic for this purpose." The letter was as follows: "Boston, Jan. 24, 1861. HON J.M. WIGHTMAN Mayor of the City of Boston: ON IGHTMAN We hereby notify you that a tumultuous and riotous assemblyof more than thirty persons is now engaged in disturbinga meeting of the .Massachusetts Anti-slavery (societyat Tremont Temple, and we hereby request you, inyour official capacity, to quell the riot and protect theproperty where the meeting is now being held to wit,Tremont Temple. Yours, respectfully, WM.H.JAMESON, GEO.W.CHIPMAN, GEO.S.DEXTER, JOSEPH STOKY, T.GILBERT." Shouts of derisive laughter were heard on all sides,at the conclusion of the letter, for everybody saw thatthe request was one totally different from that statedby the Mayor. At this point, Mr. Quincy inquired if Sheriff Clarkwas in the hall, stating that there was a letter of importancefor him from the Governor. It was generallysupposed that the letter had reference to the preservationof order, but its real character did not transpire. Having read the letter of the Trustees, the Mayorturned to Mr. Quincy, the acting President, and asked,"What do you want me to do I" Mr. Quincy repliedthat he wished the galleries cleared, and the Mayorinstructed the officers to perform that duty, and theyentered upon it immediately, and in about fifteenminutes, the galleries were cleared, no resistance beingoffered. Many of the rioters, however, as they camedown stairs, entered the doors at the end of the halluntil that portion was densely crowded with an uproariouscrowd, enraged at the aspect of things, andexcitedly yelling, "Clear the platform!" "Wightman!we want you to clear the platform!" With thismodest demand, however, the Mayor did not see fit tocomply. The work of clearing the galleries was finished at4:35, and then the President said:— Mr. QUINCY. The members of the Anti-SlaverySociety, and those who desire to participate with them,will be seated. UINCY. It was found impossible to seat the numbers whohad crowded upon the platform, and the President inquiredof the Mayor if the orderly portion of the audienceon the platform could occupy the galleries; towhich the Mayor replied in the affirmative, and sooncomparative order was restored. THE MAYOR. Gentlemen, (I shall not say ladiesand gentlemen, because that is always unnecessary,)the meeting is now in a quiet state; it is for you tomaintain it so. As long as there is no disturbance byany one, it will go on with its proceedings. If thereis any disturbance, the police are authorized to suppressany demonstrations of that kind. (Applause,and three cheers for free speech.) HE AYOR. Mr. QUINCY. If the gentlemen on the edges of themeeting are contented to remain and assist in thefurther proceedings, they can do so; if not, the policewill forthwith clear the hall of all disturbers. UINCY. The Mayor then called two of the Lieutenants ofPolice to the platform, and gave them instructionswith regard to the disposition of their men, and thatthey were to be under the direction of the Presidentof the meeting. Then, turning to Mr. Quincy, theMayor said—"Mr. President, I now give the meetinginto your hands, and take my leave." There were no more cheers for Mayor Wightman;but the rabble that still remained in the rear of thehall cheered for the Union, and one of their numberput the question, "All those in favor of adjourningthe Union meeting will say "Aye," and declared it"a vote"—but still the crowd of unruly spirits remained,though then? demonstrations were not so violentas before. Mr. QUNICY. I now request all the members andfriends of the Society to be seated, as far as possible.If there be any disturbance in the further proceedingsof the meeting, I shall direct the further part of thehall to be cleared. Let that be understood, beforehand.We want all to stay and hear what is to besaid; we do not want to tarn a man of you out. Ifyou have anything to say against any of the sentimentsthat have been expressed here, the platform isjust as free for yon to oppose as for the previous speakersto advocate them. Mr. Hoyt will bow proceedwith his speech. UNICY. Mr. CHAIRMAN,—When the proceedings of the Conventionwere interrupted, oar friends in the rear of thehall had just concluded that familiar psalm tune, towhich our ears have became so accustomed, "We aregoing home." After a great deal of "going" and"goings on," some of oar friends have actually left,and for that we are certainly obliged. (Applause.) HAIRMAN Some weeks ago, Mr. Chairman and ladies and gentlemen,we who live upon the bilk of Western Massachusettsreceived tidings from Boston which filled uswith wonder and with disgust. (Misses.) Wonder—that upon the free soil of the old Commonwealth ofMassachusetts, even in Boston—Boston, where thetribunes of the people hare spoken since liberty had aname and a foothold upon the American continent—Boston, under the shadow of Banker Hill—the Bostonof Faneuil Hall,—one man should have been found sofalse to his manhood and so recreant to his social trust,as for one single moment to entertain the purpose tointerfere with the free discussion of the question ofanti-slavery. Disgust, I say also, that when a considerablebody of men entertaining this contemptible purposewere found willing and ready to Invade this veryTemple, and here successfully assail the dearest rightan American can possess, the strong right arm of municipalauthority was not instantly outstretched to quellthe mob, and, in the name of law, liberty, and Americancivilization, protect the respectable gentlemen hereengaged in an investigation of the merits of that question.I think it may not be egotism in me to say, thusI know well what the sentiment of Massachusetts isin regard to this matter of free speech. I will at leastundertake to speck for Middle and Western Massachusetts;and it is time that Boston Understood that thecontained in this peninsula, and that, if the people ofBoston will not vindicate and defend that right, thepeople of the Commonwealth, in their sovereign capacity,will come here and do it for them, so save ourdear old Commonwealth from that reproach. (Loudapplause, and hisses from the remnant of the mob.) Ithank God that at last he City Government of Bostonhas undertaken to defend this right to us. We wouldmaintain it ourselves, and by their aid and assistancewe shall maintain it throughout the proceedings of thisConvention. (A Voice—" I'll bet you don't.") A Voice I suppose there may be some here who would liketo know upon what basis a professed Republican of thecampaign of 1860 can stand here. I have not, hitherto,understood that there was necessarily any inconsistencybetween a Republican, believing in politicalaction as a remedy for the evils of slavery, and a associationsAbolitionist. A VOICE—" Is John A. Andrew an Abolitionists OICE Mr. HOYT. I hope to heaven he is and I think Ican say he is. If he is not, he is not true Governor ofMassachusetts. I do not mean such Republicans asis represented by the recent Sensorial speech to WilliamH. Seward; I do not mean such Republicanismas is represented by the compromises of Tom Corwin;I do not mean such Republicanism as is representedby Charles Francis Adams, who proposes to admitNew Mexico as a slave State. [The rosters—"Threecheers for Adams."] I do not mean such Republicanismas is represented, for instance, by the SpringfieldRepublican,—a smart Journal in the western part of theState, which has not, until lately, found dirt enough tocat,—which says the Republicans are not opposed toslavery as a sin per sr, but because it is a ruinous system,regarded as a question of political economy ButI mean such Republicanism as would legislate eternalliberty into the Territories. [Here there was a rushand surge in the back part of the hall, and every indicationof a row. The lights were put out under thegallery, and, for a moment, a serious disturbance wasanticipated; but nothing came of it; the gas was againset aflame, and Mr. Hoyt proceeded.] I mean suchRepublicanism as would legislate eternal liberty intothose Territories which are the common inheritance ofthe people of the whole country. That is the sort ofRepublicanism I mean; and as I have hitherto been aRepublican and a conscientious Abolitionist. so hereand now, because my reason and my heart prompt meto make the declaration, I declare that I am also infavor of Disunion. (Applause, hisses, and cries of"Put him out.") And, as conscientiously as I havehitherto been a Republican and an Abolitionist I declareto-day that I believe the Southern States have aright to secede, and will secede, ["Good,"] and I amglad of it. (Applause and hisses.) For slavery is asthe "Thunderer" of the London press declared, "adisgrace to the whole nation;" and when at last theslave States have gone out of the Union by themselves,they will have taken away form the remaining Statesof the Confederacy the disgrace and ignominy of becomingresponsible, to any extent, for the intolerablecurse and crime of human bondage. (Hisses.) So Isay the slave States have seceded, and will stayin that attitude, and I am glad of it, because I see inthat condition of affairs a bright ray of hope for thepersecuted and oppressed negro. [A Voice—"Whydon't you fight for him"] In the course of events,those States will either abolish slavery as a matter ofself-preservation (and God speed that day) of else thesun of some morning will shine on another St Domingo,and many and many another Tourist(Cheers and hisses.) OYT. Republican per sr A Voice I stood by the side of John Brown in the hour ofhis trial (applause, groans, hisses, and yells); Istood by his side in the scene of his mock trial andhis persecution—[A Voice—" Shame of you!"] and Iwould have remained by him until be was executed,if a Southern mob had not driven me from the places.("Good"—"good," cried the rowdies.) Mind youI have stood in the face of a Southern mob, and Ishall not retreat in the face of a Boston mob("Good"—and applause.) By the side of JohnBrown, in the presence of that manly resignation andthat heroic fortitude which struck the world dumbwith admiration, I registered in my heart a solemnvow, that so long as God permits me to live upon thisearth, His footstool, I will, all the powers Hegiven me, oppose the cursed institution of slavery,even to its utter abolition. (Loud applause and hisses.)Entertaining these convictions, I am no man if I occupyany other position than the one I do occupy today.I am here to-day because Boston tells me thatupon this platform I shall not declare slavery to be acurse and a crime; because Boston declares that thepeople of Massachusetts shall not clear themselves ofthe iniquity of the institution. I am here to-day becauseI am instructed that it is unpopular to standhere. If that be the case, I think God for that unpopularity,and I hope to carry a large amount of thatunpopularity along with me through life. (Applauseand hisses.) A Voice I have said all and more than I intended when Itook this position; but I could not consent that myfeeble speech should be broken up by a combined andmenacing mob in the city of Boston, where I havelived ten years. I saw in that gallery and in the rearof this hall, many and many a young man with whomI have associated in this city; some with whom I wasin the public schools, and many with whom I haveassociated in other relations; and I should have felt atto be a lasting disgrace if, when their voices were upraisedto silence me, I had submitted. I truer, fellowcitizens, ladies and gentlemen, that all men who believein the crime and wickedness of the institution ofslavery, and have hitherto declared their belief in thenecessity for its utter abolition, in the process of timenow that it has become unpopular to express theiropinions, will not run the risk of being written downexecrable cowards by withholding the truth to-dayLet the truth be spoken, be the consequences whatthey may. (Loud applause.) The meeting then adjourned, to re-assemble at half past 7 o'clock. ☞Having thus brought down the proceedings ofthe meeting to the adjournment on Thursday afternoons,we copy from the Journal the following accountof what took place in the evening, and the suppressionof the meeting by order of the Mayor:— Journal Some fifty or sixty women remained in the hall afterthe adjournment of the meeting in the afternoonThey, with a few other persons who were able to getearly admission in the half, were the audience addressedby the Chief of Police, as half past six o'clockwhen that functionary appeared and read the followingorder from the Mayor's office:— MAYOR'S OOFFICE, CITY HALL,BOSTON, Jan. 24, 1861, 6 o'clock, P.M. AYOR'S OFFICE ITY ALL OSTON DANIEL J. COBURN, Esq., Chief of Police. ANIEL OBURN SIR: You are hereby ordered to clear the Half of TremontTemple are hereby any persons now remaining, and closethe doors, and take such measures as may be necessary toprevent any meeting being held there so-night. IR JOSEPH M. WIGHTMAN, Mayor. Mr. Wightman also sent the following communicationto the trustees of the building:— MAYOR'S OFFICE, CITY HALL,DOSTON, Jan 24, 1861, 6 o'clock, P.M. AYOR'S FFICE ITY ALL OSTON Messrs. W.H. Jameson, George W. Chipman, and othersTrustees of the Tremont Temple. GANTLEMEN; I have reliable information, received sinceI left the meeting, which, in my judgment, renders it atleast imprudent to have another meeting held at the TremontTempe to-night. ANTLEMEN I therefore assume the responsibility closing the hallof that building against any further meeting to-night andI have given the necessary orders to the police so that effect. JOSEPH M. WIGHPMAN, Mayor We understand that the Mayor revived information,which be considered reliable, that if the meeting washalt in the evening the outside of the building wouldbe attached by a mob, and in order to prevent a disturbance,be ordered the Hall closed.  There upon the audience dispersed, and the doorswere closed. The crowd in the street before the Hall constantlyincreased, and at 7 o'clock the passage of vehicleswas a matter of no small difficulty. The Chief ofpolice assured the crowd that the Hall would not beopened during the evening, and thereupon three cheerswere given for the Police of Boston, and three groansfor the Legislature of Massachusetts. Until this time,the crowd would not believe that the meeting was nota take place, but regarded the thing as a ruse to drivethem off; nor did the assurance of the Chief carry fullconviction to their minds. To make a sure thing ofseveral attempts were made to force the upper sideentrance.  The door successfully resisted, however.The cry of "a now!" was raised, and a rush wasmade toward the Montgomery Buildings, but nothingbut a few broken panes of glass in the windows of theTremont Rooms resulted from this. A few minuteslater, a cry of "Fall in" was raised on the west sidewalkof Tremont street, opposite the hotel, and inaudience to the general call, an irregular processionwas formed and marched, in no very good order, in asoutherly direction. Suddenly, those who were atthe head of this impromptu procession rushed directlyacross the street, in the direction of Montgomeryplace.  The object of this rush was soon apparent.One John C. Cluer, somewhat notorious in this city,was seized; he broke loose, reached the steps of theMontgomery House, was seized again, pulled downthe steps, thrown down upon the sidewalk and kickedin several places, as he avers, to his own great injury.A gentleman, accompanied by a lady, interfered;Cluer got up and got away, the crowd passively lookingon the while. He was forthwith joined by somefriends, with whom he ran down Montgomery place.The crowd followed in hot pursuit, but the pursuedcreeded in escaping to the Anti-Slavery Office, andsubsequently found his way to the Fourth Police Stateswhere he recounted his wrongs. The police made strenuous efforts to clear the streets,as they were successful. By 8 o'clock the crowd hadvery nearly disappeared from the street, and the moreturbulent portion thereof took refuge in the TremontHouse bar-room, which was filled to its utmost capacityfor nearly an hour. The amount of drinking, however,was by no means proportional to the crowd. Achair served as a rostrum for various speakers. Thefirst speaker diverted his views on the topics of theday—secession, coercion, metropolitan police, freespeech, &C—at considerable length, and until he was that his remarks had ceased to be acceptable.The next had not risen to make any extended remarks,but merely to propose three cheers for "Hon. LuciusSade and his letter." Finally, a young man, whosename was announced to be Lee—supposed to be theperson who appears hereinafter as having been arrestedby the Fourth Police, under another name, mountedthe chair, and proposed that all hands "step up to thebar and drink, and then adjourn to Johnny Gallagher's, in Howard street, and there organize and go toto Phillip's house, and carve him out." He continued,"How many will go!" About a dozen persons heldup their hands, a few cries of "Hoe hun out!""Carve him out!" &C, also responded. The personswho were assumed to be the recognized leaders of themob disappeared, at this time, from public view, andwere not seen again in any of the demonstrations ofthe evening.   Finally, the crowd, with some apparent reluctance,marched away in something like order. From the Tremont House, a large crowd rusheddown Tremont street, booting, hallooing, and urgingeach other on by the call of "Howard street! Howardstreet". In front of the Athenxum the crowd haltedand demanded to be organized, whereupon the personwho passed under the name of Harry Lee at the barroommounted some stone steps, took off his hat, and called attentions to the object of their assembly.Motions were made to adjourn to Essex street,and thus individual put in to vote, and adjourned themto that place. The crowed immediately turned out ofHoward street, shouting, "To Wendell Phillips's, toWendell Phillips's," and all started for that point.  Upon arriving in front of the residence of Mr.Phillips, a small crowd, under the leadership of onewho bore a striking resembalence to Harry Lee, commencedsinging, "Tell John Andrew," &C To thisthey added a stave, in which they expressed theirconviction that "salt won't save him." Groans and followed, as a matter of course, the crowdbeing constantly augmented by delegations from theTremont House and Howard street, who joined inthe disturbance. In a short time, Deputy Chief ofPolice Ham made his appearance upon the steps ofMr. Phillips's house, and was soon reinforced by astrong detachment of officers from the Fourth Station.Mr. Ham addressed the crowd, informing them of hisofficial character, and giving them the choice of eitherrunning to their homes or being taken to the stationhouse, at the same time directing the officers to clearthe street, which by this time was pretty well filled.It was noticeable, however, that those who had beenthe loudest at the Tremont House in urging the crowdago were not with them.  The officers proceeded promptly to the discharge oftheir duty, and soon the crowd was dispersed. In thecourse of these proceedings, a young man, resemblingthe ubiquitous Harry Lee, while in the act of informingthe crowd, in musical accents, that he wouldn'tgo home till morning, was arrested and taken to thestation house. He was arrested as one Foster, whichname he repudiated, and claimed the surname of Eldridge.Notwithstanding his avowal in the street thathe wouldn't go home till morning, he now insistedthat he was on his way to the Old Colony depot, tomake the half-past nine o'clock train for home, and insupport of his statement, he exhibited a note addressedto his wife, informing her that he should not be athome till late, as he was going to the Anti-Slaverymeeting at the Tremont Temple. When questioned,he acknowledged that he had made a speech in thebarroom of the Tremont House, but was innocent ofall evil intentions. He was retained in custody. A was also arrested for taking part in the disturbance.Before ten o'clock, the streets were cleared,and the city was as quiet as ever.  On Friday morning, the general public being unawarethat it had been decided by the officers of theSociety not to attempt to hold any further meeting,since they had been ejected from their hall by theMayor a large number of people assembled at the doorsof the Temple, at an early hour, some of them evidentlyfriends, but the majority, as evidently, of thecharacter of those who had disturbed the precedingmeetings, if not the same individual rioters. Thepolice, who were stationed at the doors, informed thecrowd that no meeting was to be held there that day,which satisfied the well-disposed, who left at once; butthe rabble were incredulous, and, regarding the statementas a "weak invention of the enemy" to deprivethem of their anticipated fun, hung about the doors, entered the side door, which leads to the rooms ofthe Young Men's Christian Association, and the officesof other tenants, visiting, without ceremony, anyapartment which they chose, and making themselvesgenerally obnoxious by their rowdyish conduct and talk.   Mr. Hayes, the agent of the building, repeatedlyassured the introduces that there was to be no meeting,that the officers of the Society had resolved not toand their meeting by permission of the Mayor,—andrequested them to withdraw, but without avail; andnot until the hour appointed for the meeting, (10o'clock) had long passed, did the crowd evince anydesposition to leave. At length, however, the policewere able to clear the street, and restore order andquiet. permission BUSINESS MEETING AT THE ROOMS OF THE SOCIETY. A large number of the members and friends of theMassachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, finding the Templeclosed against them, assembled at its Room, 221Washington street, where the events of the precedingday, the conduct of the city authorities, and incidentalmatters were the topics of animated conversation forconsiderable time. The reason for the discontinuanceof the meeting not being generally understood,the advent of the officers of the Society was lookedfor with much interest; and when Mr. Quincy andMr. May entered the room, they were besieged by ahost of inquirers, anxious to learn the exact positionof affairs. At length, in order to satisfy all present,Mr. QUINCY called the meeting to order, and said:— UINCY You all know how your meeting was interfered withyesterday, and how it was concluded in comparativegood order, by the interference of the Mayor. Whenhe came there, be intended, undoubtedly—I am willingto believe, through a mistakes impressions of the respectof the Trustees—to clear the hall. When informedof the error, he cleared the disturbers out,and put us in possession of the hall. He then came to me, and asked me what I wantedhim to do; and from that time forward be took thepart of a good magistrate. He left me a force of policeto keep order. Mr. Hoyt concluded his speech,and good order was kept—at least, he could be heard.The Mayor also said to me that he recognized the legalitiesof our meeting, and would protect us. recognized the legalitiesof our meeting, and would protect us. He then said to me: Now I have restored to you thecontrol of the meeting; now, sir, I wish you to considerwhether it is well for you to hold a meeting to-night.The authorities are often unable to controlthe fury of mobs when excited, and are overborne byforce. He virtually asked me to have no meeting in meevening. I said I could not decide; that it belongedto the Society to do so; but that I was sure they wouldnot forego the evening meeting. I told him that ticketswere to be used, and I did not believe there wouldbe any disturbance. What influences were brought to bear upon theMayor afterwards, I do not know; but you all knowof the unfortunate orders which were issued after heleft us. Last night, we met and talked the matter over witha few friends, and we concluded to-day that we wouldnot recognize the right of the Mayor to turn us outlast night, by accepting his permission to use the hallto-day. HENRY C. WRIGHT. I wish to state that no orderwas served on the Trustees; it was the Chief ofPolice. I was there, and saw him in the hall. It hasbeen stated that the order was served on the Trustees. ENRY RIGHT. SAMUEL MAY, Jr. Both statements are right; anorder was sent both to the Chief of Police and theTrustees. AMUEL AY Mr. WRIGHT. Well, the Trustees were not presentat the meeting. RIGHT. A.T. FOSS. The Mayor, I understand, sent ordersto have the Temple closed to-day. OSS. Mr. QUNICY. Well, we got ahead of him there. UNICY. SAMUEL MAY, Jr., moved that a meeting of theSociety be held in this room at 12 o'clock. AMUEL AY Several persons inquired, "Why not now?" and,after some little discussion, Mr. May amended his motionso that it should read to hare the meeting calledimmediately, and in that shape it passed, without objection. At this point, three of the Trustees of the Templeentered die room, and said that they had called for thepurpose of ascertaining the correctness of a statementwhich had been made to them by the city authorities,to the effect that the Society had declined to occupythe hall that day. They were ready, they said, toopen the hall, and only wished to be certain as to thewishes of the Society. Mr. QUINCY repeated the statement he had alreadymade to the meeting upon this subject, and said thathe would communicate to the Trustees, in writing,the action of the officers of the Society, and their reasonsfor it, and these gentlemen took their leave. UINCY Mr. MAY then moved a vote of thanks to the Trusteesof the Tremont Temple for their firm and manlycourse, and for their devotion to the interests of libertyand free speech, which was passed by acclamation. AY A gentleman here said, "We may thank MayorWightman for all this." To which Mr. Quincy replied—"Mayor Wightman is of no consequence.Why, gentlemen, there is no such man as MayorWightman." (Laughter.) Mr. BUFFUM. Mr. Chairman, some of us are anxiousto know whether there is such a man as GovernorAndrew! UFFUM. The CAIRMAN. Let us leave these personal matterstill another time, and attend to our regular business. AIRMAN. Mr. WRIGHT then moved that the Society proceedto the choice of officers for the ensuing year. Carried. RIGHT Mr. MAY moved that the old list be chosen, and thatMr. Jackson's letter of declination be referred to theManaging Committee of the Society, and that they berequested to invite Mr. Jackson to withdraw his declination,and remain as President. Carried. AY The question was then put on the adoption of theresolutions submitted by Mr. Phillips on Thursdaymorning, and they were carried unanimously. Mr. MAY then read the following resolution:— AY Resolved, That in the death of the Rev. Dr. CHARLESLOWELL, the American slave and the colored people of this .country have lost s warm-hearted, generous, and steadfastfriend. His sincere and transparent soul would not refuse,and could not conceal, a warm interest and sympathy inthe cause which has sought and still seeks to gain, forthis oppressed race, their rights as men, as citizens, and asequal children of the great and loving God. Early impressedby their wrongs and by their claims upon him as a man andas a minister of Christ, he continued faithful unto death.In the later years of his life, although suffering greatly frombodily disease and pain, no subject was nearer to his heart;and among the last words which he committed to writing, afew hours before his death, was an expression of his deepinterest in a family of American slaves, and in their restorationto freedom, and his heartfelt "God-speed" to thework of redeeming our country from the sin and the shameof slavery. We mourn his departure, for he was a trulyupright, single-minded and Christian man, whose life wasa connecting link between these times and the purer andbetter days of the churches of Boston, whose instructivevoice ever showed the path of duty, and whose persuasiveexample called us to walk in it; and now that we can seehis face no more, we would invoke a double portion of hisspirit to be with us, in these days of our nation's vacillationin duty and want of faith in God. HARLES OWELL The resolution was adopted unanimously. Rev. ADIN BALLOU, of Hopedale, offered the followingresolution:— DIN ALLOU Resolved, That this Society has aimed at nothing, proposednothing, and done nothing, but what is in strict accordancewith love to God and ail mankind. That it has exercised only the acknowledged natural andconstitutional rights belonging to all of the people ofMassachusetts. That we have demeaned ourselves in all respects as peaceablecitizens of the Commonwealth, and that our regulartwenty-ninth annual meeting has been causelessly brokenup by the mob and Mayor of Boston. That we abate not a jot of our testimony against chattelslavery, whose dupes have trampled on our sacred rights;that we will persistently assert and exercise those rights tothe fullest extent of our ability as peaceable citizens. That we throw the entire responsibility of the outragesperpetrated against us in the breaking up of our meetingon the Mayor of Boston, and that we appeal with confidencefrom his mal-administration of government to theBoston that will be, to the country, to the civilized world,and to Almighty God. H.C. WRIGHT. I move to amend by making it read—"appeal to the State and country." RIGHT. Mr. BALLOT. I think Massachusetts is included inthe phrase "civilized world." (Laughter.) ALLOT. A VOICE. I move to amend by making the Mayoralone responsible for the riot. He was the real cause,and the mob were only his tools. OICE. ANOTHER. I move to make it read "the Mayor andhis mob." NOTHER. the Mayor andhis mob. Somebody moved to amend by an insertion that"the Mayor has done his duty." THE CHAIRMAN. What is your name, sir?. HE HAIRMAN. GENTLEMAN. My name is John Davies, of the BostonMuseum. ENTLEMAN. The CHAIRMAN stated that this was a meeting ofthe Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, and that onlymembers of that Society could submit motions or vote,though any one was at liberty to speak. HAIRMAN Mr. DAVIES thereupon frankly apologized, statingthat he had supposed the meeting a public one, or heshould not have offered his amendment. AVIES Mr. QUNINCY then remarked that it was desirable toconclude their business as soon as possible, inasmuchas they could not toll how soon the mob might paythat room a visit, and there were many tenants in thebuilding whose rights should be rejected and caredfor. He hoped, therefore, the several amendmentswhich had been suggested would not be pressed. Nofurther remarks being offered, the question was put,and the resolution of Mr. Ballou adopted. UNINCY It was stated that there were several other resolutionswhich it was desired to present to the Society,but, in view of the circumstances, it was not thoughtadvisable to occupy time by reading them; whereupona motion was made, and carried, that all remainingrevolutions be referred to the Board of Managers, tobe inserted in the proceedings of the meeting, if theythink best. The meeting then adjourned, sine die. sine die. Towards the close of the meeting, seems of TremontTemple rioters had found their way to the building,and stood about the door, annoying the people whoentered or came out by blocking the passage, and bytheir insulting remarks. A police force was sent for,who, on their arrival, dispersed the crowd, and keptguard for a while at the door, to prevent the entranceof any suspicious persons. No serious disturbance,however, of any kind, occupied. ☞ During the day, Mr. QUINCY sent the followingnote to the Trustees of the Temple, in accordancewith his promise mentioned above:— UINCY ANTI-SLAVERY ROOMS, BOSTON, Jan. 25, 1861 NTI LAVERY OOMS OSTON TO THE TRUSTERS OF THE TRENONT TEMPLE: O THE RUSTERS OF THE RENONT EMPLE GENTLEMEN,—The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Societyhaving been shut out of the Tremont Temple, of whichthey were lawful possessors, by contract with you, lastnight, by order of the Mayor, have instructed me to informyou that they shall decline occupying the Temple to-dayat they had originally intended. The Mayer having turnedus out of the hall, we decline to recognize his right to dothat illegal action by consenting to go into it again by histacit or express permission. The responsibility of preventingthe assembling of a meeting of citizens for the purposeof the expression and discussion of opinion now rentsupon the Mayor, and we do not choose to relieve him ofany portion of it by any action of ours. ENTLEMEN I have much pleasure in transmitting to the Trustees thethanks of the Society, unanimously voted at a meetingheld at their rooms this morning, for their firm and manlyconduct in maintaining freedom of speech within their hallto the utmost of their ability. I have the honor to be, gentlemen, with great respect,your obedient servant, EDMUND QULNCY,Acting President of the Society. ☞ At a meeting of the Board of Managers of theMassachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, on Saturday,January 26th, it was voted that the following Preambleand Resolutions be adopted, and published with theproceedings of the Annual Meeting, at which theywere intended to be presented:— Resolved, That this Society cordially adopts, as speciallyapplicable to the lawless attempts bow making to suppressall discussion of the subject of slavery, both in thiscity and elsewhere, the following series of resolutions, writtenby WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING, presented by BENJAMINF. HALLETT, Esq., and supported by George S. HILAND,Esq., at a meeting of the citizens of Boston, held inFaneuil Hall, December 8th, 1837, to protest against themurder of the martyred Abolitionist, Rev. ELIJAN P. LOVEJOY,at Alton, Illinois:— ILLIAM LLERY HANNING ENJAMIN ALLETT ILAND LIJAN OVEJOY "Resolved, That it has pleased God to commit to thispeople, above all others, the cause of human freedom; thatwe are called to the high office of manifesting the power offree institutions to ennoble and bless a people; and that inproving false to this trust, we shall not only east away ourown happiness, but shall betray the interests of the humanrace, and shall deserve the condemning sentence of all nationsand of future times. Resolved, That to offer violence to the rights of the citizensin a free country, where these rights are understoodand recognized and taken under the protection of the laws,is a more heinous crime, and of more fatal influence, thanthe oppressions of absolute hereditary power. Resolved, That among oar rights, we hold none meredear than the freedom of speech and the press; that welook to this as the guardian of all other rights, and thechief spring of human improvement; so that to wrest itfrom the citizen, by violence and murder, is to inflict thedeepest wound on the republic. Resolved, That, by the ordination of Providence, we arepassing through a stage of society in which principles andinstitutions are subjected to the severest scrutiny, and that,at such a period, earnest conflicts of opinion cannot be escaped,and ought to be cheerfully endured as inseparablefrom the exercise of a privilege which is essential to theprogress and best interest of the human race. Resolved, That it is the fundamental idea of freedom ofspeech and the prate, that the citizen shall be protected fromviolence, in uttering opinions opposed to those which prevailaround him; that if by such freedom nothing more wereintended than the liberty of publishing whit nine would deny,then absolute government might boast of it as loudly at republics;to that to put the citizen in peril, on the around that hepresumptuously perseveres in uttering whit is unpopular, orwhat the majority do not approve, is to assail this freedom in itsvery foundation, and to destroy very life. That it is the fundamental idea of freedom ofspeech and the prate, that the citizen shall be protected fromviolence, in uttering opinions opposed to those which prevailaround him; that if by such freedom nothing more wereintended than the liberty of publishing whit nine would deny,then absolute government might boast of it as loudly at republics;to that to put the citizen in peril, on the around that hepresumptuously perseveres in uttering whit is unpopular, orwhat the majority do not approve, is to assail this freedom in itsvery foundation, and to destroy very life. Resolved, That in a free country, the laws, enacted accordingto the prescriptions of the Constitution, are thevoice of the people, and are the only forms by which the sovereigntyof the people is exercised and expressed; and thatof consequence a mob, or a combination of citizens for thepurpose of suspending by force the administration of thelaws, or of taking away rights which these have guarantied,is treason against the people, a contempt of their soveignty,and deserves to be visited with exemplary punishment. Resolved, That the spirit of mobs is a spirit of indiscriminatedestruction; that when the press [or freedom ofspeech] shall have become its prey, its next victim will beproperty; that there is no power on earth so terrible ashuman passion, unbridled by principle and law, and inflamedto madness by the sympathies of a crowd; and thatif we silently and passively abandon any portion of ourfellow-citizens to this power, we shall have no right to complainwhen our own turn shall come to feed Its rapaciousnessand fury. Resolved, That in this country the mightiest influence ispublic opinion; that mobs cannot prevail without a criminalapathy in the public mind; that one of the darkestomens of our times is the indifference with which the nationhas looked on the triumphs of lawless force; and thatthe time is now come for this people to shake off theirlethargy, to vindicate the insulted majesty of the laws, andto pronounce a sentence on unprincipled violence, which thereckless and turbulent will be unable to withstand. Resolved, That the Christian is not authorized by his religionto look with indifference on public affairs, and thathe ought particularly to he roused by acts of cruelty andviolence which degrade our country to the level of heathenism." Whereas, one most important means of checking thatdeterioration in morals and religion, which complicity withslavery has brought upon the American Church, is foundin the utterance of faithful admonition and rebuke by sisterchurches in other countries; and Whereas, a portion of the Baptist churches in GreatBritain have faithfully performed this duty in the ease ofRev. Dr. Baron Stow, minister of the Rowe Street Churchin Boston—first inquiring of himself (during his late visitto England) as to the truth of certain reports injuriously affectinghis character as a minister—then comparing his replieswith Indisputable facts in their possession respectinghis relation to slavery, to caste, and to anti-slavery—thenagain appealing to him with the inquiry whether he couldexplain some things that were found incorrect, and somethat appeared evasive and disingenuous in his originalstatement—and, finally, (when he took refuge in silence,and, for six months after their letter of inquiry, still refrainedfrom returning any answer.) using the proof ofhis various and pertinacious complicity with slavery as thebasis of an appeal to the Baptist churches of this countryagainst the continuance of their complicity with it; therefore— caste their 1. Resolved, That the thanks of the slave and hisfriends are due to the London Board of Baptist Ministers—and especially to Rev. William H. Bonner, pastor of theTrinity Street Baptist Church, London, to whose diligencein making this examination, and to whose faithfulness inreporting its results, the action in question is mainly to beattributed—and that we hail with joy this beginning of adiscrimination on the part of British Christiana betweenthe "profession" and the practice of religion in America. 2. Resolved, That church-members, alike in thiscountry and in England, should be stimulated to faithfullabors in behalf of the slave by the unquestionablefact that these labors are urgently demanded for the purificationof the church and that in no way can they benefitthe church more effectually than by striving for the utteroverthrow of that slavery which, in this country, hasbeen the most fertile source of her corruptions. 3. Resolved, That the fast-coming events of the presenttime loudly echo the call, which duty has always madeupon American ministers, to do what the sew truly Christianmembers of their body have long since done, namely,to preach strongly on our national sin of slaveholding, andon the guilt of that support which our Northern religionand politics, literature and trade, have hitherto chosen tovolunteer in its behalf. 4. Resolved, That the following events, occurring withinthe past year, illustrate the truth, at the present time,of that which was long ago said by an Orthodox church-memberHon. James G. Birney, of Kentucky that "theChurch is the great bulwark of slavery":— 1. The action of the Methodist Episcopal Church, which,protruding to revise her "Discipline,"(in the quadrennialGeneral Conference which met at Buffalo, N.Y., in 1894,)left in it the allowance of membership of many themed ofslaveholders. 2. The agen preaching, by Northern ministers of variousdenominations, of the latest phase of Southern destine,namely, that slavery is appointed and approved by God,and beneficial to all the parties concerned in it. 3. The letter sent by Rev. Gardiner Spring, D.D., ofNew York, and many other eminent clergyman of thatcity and Philadelphia, through the "religions" papers, totheir slaveholding brethren, expressing, (in substance )hearty sympathy with their regrets at the decline of theSlave Power. 4. The continuance in a thoroughly pro-slavery punitionof that great representative body, the America Trust Society. 5. The time-serving policy pursued by the Boston TrustSociety, which emphatically declares itself "not anti-slavery,"even which venturing to stop so far in advance of itsfarmer position as to discuss,"fraternally" towards theslaveholders, "then moral evil and vises which slavery isknown to promote." discuss fraternally 6. The evince in guilty completely with slavery madeby the American Board of Commissioners— for Foreign Missions,who now publicly declare the slaveholding nation ofCherokees to be "a Christian people," and further declarethat their missionaries (who for forty-three years have favoredthe continuance of slavery there,) have been "exemplaryin the discharge of all their missionary duties." all 7. The continuance in a position of substantial aid toslavery by the "religious press" (so called), whether, likethe How York Observer, it upholds that wickedness in full,or whether, like the Independent, it upholds it only in theChurch and the "American Board."
