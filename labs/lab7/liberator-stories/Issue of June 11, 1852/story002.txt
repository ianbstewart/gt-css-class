 Untrammelled by any ties between Church andState, bound by no universal creed, and fettered byto articles of faith, the American people are stillearnestly a religious and a Christian people. Theprinciples of toleration which prevail throughout ourland are founded in and grow out of the fundamenttaltruths of Christianity. Charity—that charity, wemean, which respects the belief, the practice, and the prejudices of a brother, 'which judges not,let he be judged'—may be considered almost a nationalcharacteristic. Once it was quite so; but oflater years, in certain quarters, a cloud has arisen,which, though at first no bigger than a man's hand, increased as time rolled on, until at last it hasacquired dimensions so portentous, and so deep a as to obscure in one direction our politicalhorizon, and to darken to a certain extent the moraland religious atmosphere which surrounds us. It isthe cloud of anti-slavery fanaticism. Originatingin the gloomy mists of infidel philosophy—exhaled Stygian swamps, where those who questionteh decrees of Providence are doomed to flounder—for the breath of fierce religious bigotsand political demagogues—it has threatenedand still threatens to overspread the brightness ofour skies, and desolate the land with fire and flood.This cloud the sun of democracy must dispel; it isthe only medium, under Providence, which everworks by human agency, through which its balefulinfluence can be averted.      It is not our purpose at present to enter into anyinquistion upon the nature and effects of abolitionists.While the examples of Saint Domingo,with the emancipated population hastening throughscenes of brutal massacre, and lost, and burning, intodespotism, and through despotism back to its originalbarbarism; while the example of the freedmenof the British West India colonies, perishing of faminein the midst of plenty, of pestilence in a salulciousclime, or fast relapsing into a state of savage doesthrough their own improvidence, uncleanliness,and imbecility of intellect, are before us; while weare able at once to contract the downward course ofwith the upward and onward properof our own favored race under the smiles ofan approving Heaven,—it needs no argument toshow that the ends of this wild fanaticism are sin anddeath, while the paths we are treading are those ofrighteousness and peace. We will not appeal toRevelation, and cite the sacred writings to proveas we could do, that the patriarchal institution ofdomestic bondage is every where recognized in them,under the Gospel as well as the Old Testament dispensation.Those who read and believe the Scripturesare already enlightened on this point, whilethose who seek the sanction of a higher law woulddeny their authority. And a higher law than that ofGod, as well as of the Constitution, must they find,too, if they would justify the attempt to make Carolinaas Saint Domingo, and the happy homes of theSouth, as the wretched inhabitants of the Lesser Antilles.The masses of the American people are sufficientlyacquainted with the character, the objects,and the ends of abolitionism; but they are not allequally well aware of the wily, stealthy, and insidiousnature of its progress, nor of the absolute necessityof putting a speedy and effectual terminationto the serpentine career. Even the whigs turnaway with digest when they hear a Quincy expresshis malignant regret that the accident which befeltheir eminent statesman and orator had not resultedand shudder when a Parker Pillsbury arisesin an anti-slavery meeting, and publicly blasphemesthe Holy Ghost. But are they blind to the fact, thatthese same impious and ferocious fanaticsaffiliate closely with the whig free-soil faction,and constantly pursuit their numbers from thatsource? Are they aware that the same relationwhich the whig free soilers bear to the abolitioniststhe northern whigs bear to them—that the processof union and combination between the three is steadilyand surely going on?—that the inevitable resultwill be an organization on the ultra abolitionprinciples? Do they reflect that from this entanglingand unworthy alliance they cannot withdrawwithout abandoning all hope of success in the comingprudential contest?—that success with itwould be followed by the disruption of the Union,the Subversion of the Constitution, the downfall ofthe government, and the exaltation in its place of thedemon of monarchy and atheism—the very abominationof desolation which reigned in the temple whenthe Roman eagles gathered around Jerusalem? Ifthey do not know this, and see it, and feel it, it istime the country did, it is time the democratic partydid, it is time that their representatives did. Thetime, too is just at band when the latter will be calledupon to perform their duty to their party, theircountry and their God, by solemnly pledging themis sustain the measures adopted to check antislaveryagitation, to put a period to the progress ofatheistical abolition sentiment, to preserve those inestimablegifts of Providence, our free institutions,our venerated Constitution, and our glorious Union,and to select from out of the many well-deservingand capable sons of the democracy, without fear, favor,or prejudice, the one best calculated faithfullyto carry out those measures, and wisely and conscientiouslyto provide over the destinies of the county.
