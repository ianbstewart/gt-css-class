 'The return of each successive anniversary of voluntaryassociations, formed for the purpose of advancingthe moral condition and well-being of man, hasbeen deemed a fitting occasion for a brief glance atthe part, for the encouragement and guidance of thefuture.' [The Report then proceeds to give an interestinghistorical sketch of the history of the Society fromits formation, at Plymouth, July 4th, 1834, to thepresent time. This we regret that we have not roomfor, as it is a history that it is well occasionally to review. The clerical character of the Society at itsformation; the catholic sentiments proclaimed in itsresolutions; the animating addresses delivered beforeit; and the contrast between the ecclesiastical characterof the original and the present members ofthe Society; all these things are recounted clearlyand faithfully. But we have not room for them. TheReport then proceeds as follows:] ecclesiastical We have thus very briefly alluded to the formationand organization of the 'Old Colony Anti-SlaverySociety,' and called attention to some of the mostimportant meetings of the Society held since its formation. We have stated that most of those who tookan interest in its organization were  ofthe several different religious denominations, andthat they have now, not only forsaken the Society,but the anti-slavery cause. A question will mostnaturally arise here, in the minds of some, if not inthe minds of many, and very justly too, what reasoncan be assigned for this change of conduct on thepart of these clergymen referred to? Why do theynot show, as formerly, co-operate with us, and theirdeacons and church members, in laboring for the abolitionof American Slavery!  We propose briefly, but candidly, to answer theseimportant questions: lst. Has the 'Plymouth County A.S. Society,'changed its position and objects, expressed in its Constitution, which was adopted at Plymouth, July 4th,1834? or has the change been effected on the part ofthese clergymen refered to? We assert distinctlyand unequivocally, that the society has been true,inexample as well as in precept, to the objects, for theaccomplishment of which, led to its formation, andthe principles adopted at its organization; but that achange has taken place on the part of those clergymen. changed its position and objects, expressed that the society has been true, What then are the objects of this Society as expressedin their Constitution? They are 'to collectand diffuse information on the true character of slavery—convince our country men of its inality in the sight of God—to show that the dutysafely and interest of all concerned, require itsabandonment; and to take all lawful, moral and religiousmeans to hasten the total abolition of slaveryin the United States.' These then are the great objectsfor the accomplishment of which this Societywas originally founded. We deny that we havesince our organization taken any steps, or adoptedany measures but what have been in  withthe objects and sentiments above expressed. yes, ithas been in , of  to these sentiments, and a carrying out into practice the objectsand precepts on which the Society is , thathas  three religions bodies and clergymen toleave and  the Society and the anti-slavery. We make this  plainly and ocally. In the  of the abolition agitation, and  the time of the  of the Oldcolony A.B. Society, the labors and efforts of theabolitionists were directed mainly against slavery asit exists at the South. We did not then, as at present, take into consideration the thousand and onecauses, that go either directly or indirectly, to givecountenance and support to it. But as the anti-slaverycar pressed onward, and as this Society was,according to her Constitution, 'collecting and diffusinginformation on the tree character of slavery,'and 'convincing our country men of its heinous criminality,' it was soon ascertained that the religion ofthe country gave no small amount of its gigantic influenceto the support and maintenance of the horridsystem of American chattel slavery! Consequently,these abolitionists who were true to duty and theslave, labored with these religions  and bodies, in order to convince them of the criminality andwickedness of giving to slavery any religions influencewhatever. They told them plainly, that muchinfluence was indeed criminal and sinful; and if ourchurches and clergymen were to be faithful to Godand the slave, they must speak out in language notto be misunderstood, against slavery and its abettors,and cease giving any religious influence whatever tothe vile system of slavery. This Society also maintainedthe same ground, and proclaimed to the worldthat chattel slavery was antagonistical to the geniusand spirit of Christianity—that the religion ofthe North, in giving its countenance and support tothe religion of the South, was indeed the bulwark ofAmerican slavery, and that duty to God and the sufferingbondman, demanded of the religion of theNorth, energetic, vigorous action, and that the supportand influence given to the religion of the slave-holdingStates, by the religion of the non-slaveholdingStates, should be immediately withdrawn, if wewould act consistent with the principles which weprofess, as anti-slavery men and Christians, and ten the redemption of the slave.              religion   Now, as naturally might be supposed, a crisis ofno small magnitude was about to take place in theanti-slavery movement. The religionists and clergymenof the North, when they first joined the gloriousmovement, little dreamed that they should be foundcriminal and guilty, in giving countenance and supportto the very system of iniquity, which they were laboringto abolish. But as the Car of Emancipation rolledonward, and the causes which go to the support ofslavery were inquired into and discussed, it was made to appear, as demonstrative as the light of thesun, in a clear atmosphere at noon day, that the religionof the North, of Massachusetts, of PlymouthCounty, on account of its connexion with the religionof the South, was indeed the great bulwark ofAmerican chattel slavery' The abolitionists nowplainly saw, and still more sensibly felt, the greatand important fact, that only one alternative was leftfor them to pursue, touching the further agitationof the anti-slavery question, in regard to religions action: and this alternative  either to from the anti-slavery cause, or fresh the  religiousorganizations. Now came the  of war.Many an abolitionist, or at least those who calledthemselves such, and had hitherto stood first andcontended  for the abolition of slavery, nowfor the first time,began to halt, to cease their laborsfor the promotion of the anti-slavery cause. Theiraction began to prove to the world, that they lovedtheir sect better than they loved the cause of sufferinghumanity! In demolishing the building, theyassisted manfully in removing the exterior; but whenthis was accomplished, and the frame-work whichsupported the exterior, and the building was discovered, they fell back with astonishment, in viewof the immense labor and sacrifice required, in orderto demolish the building. The hammer and the chiselis now by them no longer used, and the thereof, consequently, no longer heard. The alternative, therefore, chosen by them, is to remain withinand around the building, and we are fearful thatwhen the building falls, for soon it must, they willbe destroyed with it. very system       began to halt,  But the faithful and true abolitionists, those whohad faith in God, and the good of their fellow-manat heart, and loved the cause of God and humanitybetter than sect or party, chose the latter alternativeof withdrawing from all existing organizations, whetherreligions or political, that give countenance orsupport to American slavery. Painful as was thislast duty, yet fidelity to God and the poor sufferingbondmen demanded this sacrifice on the part of thosewho would be the faithful and  foeof slavery and its abettors.  The Old Colony Anti-Slavery Society has withstoodthe storm, bravely and manfully. Although attimes the result was somewhat doubtful, in consequenceof the  of the storm, but it yet lives,a living witness for God and humanity—the fee ofoppression wherever it is to be found. The duty ofministers and churches at the North, in relation toslavery, their pro-slavery position, &c., the considerationof which has caused the storm to beat fearfully against our little bark, and by which manyof the seamen on board were lost in the mighty deepin consequence of their hearts failing them, was consideredby this Society at an early period. The followingresolution was passed so late as 1836:   Resolved, 'That it is the duty of Christians of every denomination, to do all in their power, tent with divine revelation, to abolish slavery fromthe Church.'   The two following were passed in 1809: Received, 'That these Theological  inour land, which are conducted by pre-slavery men,are gross impositions; the great counterfeiting establishmentsof the Prince of darkness, by which hepalms upon Christendom, as the genuine ministers ofJesus, those who barter away the souls of immortalbeings for the meagre reward of popular favor.' these Theological   Received, 'That those American Churches whichsupport by their contributions, either pro-slaveryministers or newspapers, are guilty before the world,of squandering away the Lord's money.' The following preamble and resolutions were adoptedin 1840: 'Whereas, the Church and ministry of this landare emphatically the great conservators of the publicmind, and exercise a greater influence in mouldingpublic sentiment than  other class of the community; and whereas, they have pre- distinguishedthemselves as a body in opposition to theprinciples and measures of the abolitionists; thus them more guilty than any other portionof the people; therefore. Church and ministry    Resolved, That so abolitionist can consistentlysupport any Church or any minister, whose influenceis given infrid of slavery, or who throw  inthe way of our , either by apologizing for thissystem, by suffering to speak out at all prompt timesagainst  give other evidence that  have notthe  at heart.'      Thus has the Plymouth County A.S. Society spokenin days that are passed. We think it must newappear evident to all, that between the pre-slaverychurches and ministers of the North and this Society, there could be but little or no fellowship. Consequentlywe have seen those who loved their proslavery better than the cause of the slave, leave,and entirely forsake the Society, and the anti slaverycause. With the pre-slavery ministers andchurches of the country, they are now in full fellowshipand communion. We hear nothing from them,in regard to the anti-slavery movement; but calumnyand  in regard to those who are faithfullylaboring for the slave's redemption, in their onlyanti-slavery.   But we are not disheartened or dismayed; no, farfrom it. Our faith in our present position and measureesis firm and . Our meetings are generallywell attended, and although some of theformer friends of the Society have forsaken us, yetwe have others who have taken their places in greaternumbers, and of much mere moral worth. Andwe are happy to say that is the County of Plymouththere are to be found many active, firm, and truehearted friends of the slave. Great efforts are made,especially by the clergy in the county, to micropresent, and our movement. But we tell themplainly, that they will not succeed in keeping awaythe people from attendance on our meetings, Andwe now assure them and the world, that we shallcontinue to labor, in our humble way, for the redemptionof the slave, and shall speak out against apre-slavery, time-serving church and ministry, andpro-slavery political leaders and parties, compactsand Constitutions, until liberty be proclaimed throughoutall the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof.'   all
