 ☞Extract of a letter from Hon. J.R. Giddingsof Ohio, dated Washington city, June 3d,1846: GENTLEMEN: ENTLEMEN Your favor of the 19th ult. reached me by duecourse of mail, but I have been unable to find timeto answer it until this day. I will first reply to yoursecond interrogatory, by which you ask whetherI am in favor of a dissolution of the Union. I am in favor of a dissolution of the Union. Holding, as I have ever done, the perfect right ofthe constituent to understand the views of his representativeupon all political subjects, I shall cheerfullyrespond to your question. If you refer to theAmerican Union formed in 1787, as it was quently modified by the admission of , towhich each of the several States yielded its tacitconsent—my answer is, that it has been dissolvedby a revolution in our Government; that the President, and a majority in each House of Congress, inthe exercise of  powers, professing to actfor all the States, formed a new confederation withTexas, being a foreign Government, and by thatunauthorized and revolutionary act, which hassince been consummated by admitting Senatorsand Representatives of Texas to seats in Congress,the Union of 1787 has been subverted. That Unionwas entered into by the people of the several States,upon certain definite principles, clearly expressedin a written constitution. That constitution, uponwhich the Union was solely based, had been framedby a convention assembled from all the States. Butwhen it had been thus framed, it had no bindingeffect until it was submitted to the examination of thePeople of each State, and had been adopted by them.Thus we find the preamble of that great charter ofour rights commencing with these emphatic words:'WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, DOORDAIN AND ESTABLISH THIS CONSTITUTION', &c.Thus, the adoption of the constitution and the formationof the Union, was literally the act of thepeople. But it never would have received the sanctionof the patriots of that day, had not the powersof the Federal Government been specifically setforth, and the rights of the States as definitely described. The danger of unlimited powers, whenvested in any man, or number of men, was appreciatedby them; and they felt that by throwingaround the powers of the Federal Government distinctconstitutional limitation, they had secured tothemselves and offspring the great object of theirRevolutionary struggles.    People of each State, E, THE PEOPLE OF THE NITED TATES, DOORDAIN AND ESTABLISH THIS CONSTITUTION' people. The government thus formed,  certaindefinite powers, plainly expressed in the constitution, received the universal approbation of our people. These definite limitations of power were regardedas the palladium of our liberties. You andI have been bred and educated in the veneration ofthis Government, framed by the wisdom and cementedby the blood of our fathers. Forty yearsresidence among the people of our district, includingperiods of peace and of war, of public prosperityas well as adversity—in which they have knownme in private life, in my professional , in ourState Legislature, and in Congress, have given  evidence, I trust, of my  to our constitutionthan mere woods-could have done.      When I say that Congress had no constitutionalpower to  Texas to the United States, I merelyrespect the unanimous voice of our own Legislature, expressed in 1538, and  in1845; and the voice of , Rhode Island,Connecticut and Vermont, as expressed by theirseveral Legislatures: I merely reiterate the avowedsentiments of Mr. Van Buren, Mr. Forsyth, andother distinguished democratic statesmen; I but use the language of Mr. Adams, and of needyevery whig member of Congress who spoke againstthe resolutions of annexation, and of the entirewhig party, North and South; of a large portion ofthe democratic press of the North, and of manydemocratic conventions. If these five States, two ex-Presidents, distinguished and members of the House of Representatives, conventionsof the people, and public presses, werecorrect when they declared that Congress no  a foreign government to the UnitedStates, it is certain that the act thus done is void asto the people of any State to assent to it. The adherenceto the new confederation by a part of theStates, is a complete dissolution of the Union of1787. But it is quite unnecessary to refer to opinionsof statesmen. It is certain that the people ofOhio, and of every free State east of it, except NovHampshire, have at all times expressed the opinion as to the annexation of Texas; and I doubtwhether any man of character can be found itthose States so rockless as to say that the Reprsentativesand Senators from other States could constitutionallytransfer the people of Ohio or anyother State to a union with Texas, without themown consent. The constitution of 1787 providesthat 'no person shall be a Representative until he shallhave been seven years a citizen of the United State,'and that ' no person shall be a Senator until he shallhave been nine years a citizen of the United State,'By the terms of the new compact with Texas, slave-holdingSenators and Representatives who wereSpanish born, and who never saw the United Statesuntil the very day they take their seats, may nevsit in Congress, and vote for the passage of laws togovern our people of the North.         no  a foreign government to the UnitedStates   'no person shall be a Representative until he shallhave been seven years a citizen of the United State,' ' no person shall be a Senator until he shallhave been nine years a citizen of the United State,' Were the Representatives from South Carolinaand other slave States authorized by their votes totake from Northern freemen the right to be governedby Americans, and subject them to the legislationof foreigners? This change of the law-power, this subversion of the vital principles, thisoverthrow of the essential elements of the constitution, marks the character of this revolution as distinctlyas the execution of the French monarch didthe revolution of 1792, in France.  The people of Ohio are now called on to go tothe Rio Grande to meet the dangers of war and thepestilence of the climate, in order to defend theslavery of Texas. Have the freemen of Ohio everentered into a political compact to do this? Theysurely have not. I ask, then, by what authority arethey subjected to the humiliating task? The onlyanswer is, by the votes of Southern slaveholdingmembers of Congress, and Northern men whowere servilely subject to southern dictation. Havethe people of Ohio authorized those members ofCongress to subject us to dishonorable details indefence of Texan slavery? It does not require thestatesman or the jurist to answer these questions;no intelligent man, I think, in our part of the country, will differ from me when I say that no suchmoral or political obligation rests upon us. Withoutfurther remark, I repeat that our Union of 1787has been entirely dissolved; and that the people ofour State, having at all times refused their consentto such dissolution, are now absolved from all furtherpolitical obligations towards those States whichhave united in the political confederation withTexas.
