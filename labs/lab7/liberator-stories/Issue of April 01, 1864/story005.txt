 Chancing to take up a fragment of an old copy ofthe Hartford Courant, of 1850, the first paragraphthat met our eyes was the following—printed separately,by itself, to exhibit the monstrous split of theorganization to which it refers:— Courant ☞ The Anti-Slavery Society have passed resolutionsagainst Longfellow on account of his verses infavor of the Union!"—Hartford Courant, Feb. 5, 1850. Hartford Courant To-day the Hartford Courant and these same Anti-Slaverymen ARE ACTING TOGETHER! The Courantis for LINCOLN'S renomination, and so is WILLIAMLLOYD GARRISON, who originated and for twentyyears has proclaimed this motto: Courant INCOLN'S ILLIAM LOYD ARRISON "The Constitution is a covenant with Death, andthe Union is a league with Hell!" These men who passed the resolution against Mr.LONGFELLOW, and who now rejoice in toe bloodyconsummation of their life-long labors for the destructionof the Union, declare with significant and triumphantemphasis that they have not changed! Whohas!—Hartford (Copperhead)Times. ONGFELLOW Whohas Hartford (Copperhead)Times.
