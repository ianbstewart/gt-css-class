 The advocates of immediate emancipation wouldbe puzzled to provide for the colored race, such as barbarism and the peculiar kind of civilizationhave known has left them. If these liberatedchildren should seek to exchange their stern system for the holiday ease and plenty theyhope for at the North, who among our dainty philanthropistswould give them the patient training,the persistent culture requisite to develop their self-reliance?  The farce of 'What will he dowith it?' would be re-acted upon a painfully familiarstage.  The following extracts are from a work by a Massachusetts writer, entitled'The Ebony Idol.' It is from the press ofthe Appletons, and narrates the history of an escapedfugitive, a representative of at least as largea class of our colored brethren as that typified byUncle Tom.  The inexorable law of civilization,work or starve, is one that Sambo, from the very sensuousness of his being, is exceedinglyslow to learn.  In this story, a worthy clergyman of endowments gives a temporary asylum to, and labors to explain what he expects of hisin return:—        'I wish to do for you all that I can do wisely, as a Christian, but I cannot distress my familyto serve you, or squander the small means at mycommand.  I would like you to work in the garden, my wood, and do such errands and chores as will my wife. It seems to me you cannot but bewilling to do this.'    Caesar sat dog-eyed and sullen, without even to listen.  Mr. Cary spoke more warmly:I shall make inquiry for you that you may obtainemployment in some reliable family, where you canbe paid for your labor; as soon as such an opening, I shall expect you will leave us willingly.'   'Dis nigger didn't come norf to work, no how;get work enuf at de souf;' cried Caesar indignantly. 'But you must work or starve; liberty is nothingunless you can be clothed and fed.' 'Dis chile got clothed and at the souf, and twitted of it nudder,' growled Caesar.', wish you could eat one of Dinah's hoe-cakes, fixins as is fixins!'    'I beg you, Caesar, now that Providence has you from slavery—'  Providence hadn't nurthin to do about it; itwas jus' dem cussed abolitioners, and dat is fact, Cary.'  Mr. Cary groaned.  It was evident he had indeed upon fallow ground. 'Caesar, all gifts arefrom God!  He has doubtless some motive in you from a cruel task-master.'    heard any nigger, black or white, call cruel task-mass afore. He was a gemmanas is a gemman.'   Why did you leave him, then?' asked Mr.Cary a little testily. Oh, Lor only knows, coz I was seduced I spect; he heard as how dat pussens up norf didn'twork only when dey had mind; now dis chile had a mind, so I was seduced.'
