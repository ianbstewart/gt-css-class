 The very recent successful landing and dispersionof a cargo of negroes from Africa at Mobile calls upthe relations of the government to the slave trade fresh emphasis; and the question very naturallyarises whether, if this cargo had been capturedand dumped into Key West, with the combined of the Wildfire, William and Bogota, itwould be any better off than it is now. One thousandfour hundred and ninety-two wild Africanshave been carried into Key West since the 26th ofApril—enough to populate a good sized town.These negroes are hardly more than beasts. Theydo not know our language, they have no knowledgeof civilized life—they are a filthy, miserable set. Itis said that there is a good deal of sickness among, and that the deaths are very frequent, thoughit is remarked that a good many of the coffins are empty.  Whether their bodies are used forpurposes of dissection or guano, or whether theyare 'spirited away' with just a little life in them,does not appear.  It is supposed, however, that, astheir number diminishes, the stocks upon the neighboringplantations increase by some mode of transportsIt truth crushed to earth can rise again,it is barely possible that a good, strong, marketable could do it, if he should try.      It seems that the slave trade is fully re-established;and the question as to what shall be done with thecaptured negroes, whose numbers will continue tobe more or less as our naval ships execute their duty,becomes socially, morally and economically a veryimportant one.  It will be remembered that Congress,before its adjournment, appropriated $250,000, atthe suggestion of the President, for the return to of the negroes at Key West. This is a large, and this, if catching slaves becomes profitable our cruisers, is but a beginning. An arrangementhas now been entered into with the Society, for five years, to receive on the coastof Africa such negroes as our government may and support them for a limited period. What than this can be done, we do not see; but, atthis moment, steps in one of the African race astheir spokesman, and argues for their being retainedon the country.  Rev. J.W.C. Pennington, one ofthe most talented and educated Africans in the countrysays, 'Labor is needed in our land. Loud callscan be heard every day for colored help in families and the farmers East, West and North. Will some of those families and farmers take some ofthe young strangers, and train them there?' Thinkof it!  Think of taking into our families barbarianswho were bred unbreeched, and who notonly do not know anything, but who cannot readilylearn anything because ignorant of English!  Wasour proposition more absurd than this?  Such negroesas are at Key West are good for nothing butto put into gangs, where they can learn their simple by imitation.          For some reason, the best and wisest of the coloredrace have always, like Mr. Pennington, incapacity to lead in efforts for the elevationof their class.  They cling to white society, and the greatest disinclination to set up forthemselves.  There seems to be in them no pride of—no desire to found an empire—where they canlive together, and develop a society of their own.The free negroes of the North have never initiatedany movement looking toward the future educationof their race. Even Liberia has had to workagainst the smartest of the free negroes. They seemto prefer remaining where social equality can neverbe aceeded to them. Suppose any of the white race enslaved in a part of this country, and inanother part three should be a hundred thousand ofthe same race free: how long would it be before, insome part of this continent, there would be a colonyformed, that would absorb every freed man, and becomea sort of heaven on earth to the imaginationof all of kindred blood in the country? Then,when a cargo of brethren should arrive, in violationof law, who proudly would stop forward and demandthem?     We have a great number of negroes in the freeStated, and there is a large collection of escapedslaves in Canada. If they had any pluck—if thebest of them had a particle of the spirit of the whitemen, among whom it seems to be their ambition tolive—long before this time there would have been acolony of them established either here or in CentralAmerica, and a nucleus formed for an independentstate. Or they would go to Africa, their nativecountry, and call their brethren to them, and buildup a civilization that should make itself respectedby the nations of the earth. There is Mr. Fred,—Douglass— a genius—a man of power— but he apparentlynever dreams of anything bettor for hisrace than freedom and mixture with white society.We hear of no large plans for benefiting them—wesee no striking out for a future that indicates capacityfor self-government, or the institution of largeschemes, having relation to the elevation of the commonblood. Are we to have anything better thanthis? We have no hope— we have no expectation— thatour colored population will retire from a society inwhich social equality with whites can never be had;so these Key West negroes must be sent back, not,only, but all that may be captured in the futuremust be sent back. They are not wanted for labor!in free society. The white people of the free Statesare entirely capable of doing their own work, andare not anxious to increase their population frombarbaric coasts. We would, of all things, like tosee established in Africa a colony of civilized andChristianized negroes, full of industry, and powerfulenough in its vitality to receive into, and assimilateto itself, the rude materials which our cruisersmay arrest and send back. Nay, we would be contentif such a colony could be formed on this continent.When the negro himself shall demonstrate,to the world the spirit, enterprise and power necessaryfor founding and governing and establishing athrifty colony, the first step will have been takentoward the universal emancipation of the Africanrace.—Springfield Republican.
