 'I have had ample opportunity of judging impar-tially between the relative demerits of Wages andChattel Slavery in my observations at the South,and, as humiliating as the confession may appear,I would much prefer Chattel Slavery here, to Wa-ges Slavery in New-York. I say this honestly,sincerely. The glorious boon of nominal liberty,to which the Northern slave attaches such impor-tance, (to use a homely illustration). I can onlyliken to a pack horse, eating shavings through greenspectacles, and cheating himself into the beliefthat he is grazing in green pasture fields. Thecondition of the chattel in far less degrading. Heis generally well fed and better clothed than themass of wages slaves in New York. True, his lotis cruel, harsh, severe. But with him. 'ignoranceis bliss,' want and hunger are not whispering inhis heart, steal, steal; and no prison doors areyawning  to receive him when stern necessity forcessuch an alternative. He is never compelled towander houseless and homeless, begging for leaveto earn his daily food, while a starving family cries,bread and shelter. He has no time for hospitalsor alms houses. Forced labor brings him health,and his alms house is the grave. True, he mayfeel the lash, but what in this compared to the bod-ily and mental pains inflicted by the goading lashof penury, cold, hunger, the fear of panperism, orvice or crime, and the struggle to avoid them, whichthousands at the North endure, unaided or un-pitied?'â€”West Florida cures of Young America. demerits pack horse West Florida cures of Young America.
