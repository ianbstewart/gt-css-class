 We understand that the British Charged' Affairesat Washington has, under instructions fromhis government, remonstrated in very decidedterms, to the Deportment of State, against theenforcement, by the authorities of Mobile, the lawsof this State regulating the arrival of persons ofcolor at this port— said laws having been enforcedlast January against free negroes brought here bythe British ships 'Queen' and 'Portland.' Hepronounces such laws to be gross violations of thecomity of international intercourse,' in conflictwith the treaty stipulations between the two nations,and subversive of the harmony and commercialreciprocity which it is desirable to establishand maintain. We understand that the facts and circumstancesattending the cases referred to, are now undergoinginvestigation, and we are confident they willbe found to be less heinous than has been representedto the British government. Moreover, ourLegislature, at the last session, modified thelaws in question to such a degree, that we apprehendthe objectionable features are removed, andno cause of complaint will occur in future. ☞see how the Slave Power trembles at thegrowl of the British Lion' British colored subjectsmay not be molested at the South, but the coloredcitizens of New England must be shut up in prison.'
