 We have not reviewed Uncle Tom's Cabin, chief-we felt our views of the tendency and of that work to be so hostile, that we could judge of it in a proper critical manner.— believe it to possess a certain melo-dramatic equal in pathos to the 'Green Bushes' at Adelphi, and in incident to a popular novel between the style of Eugene Sue andGeorge Reynolds. But we believe it also to be de- of truth, principle and reality, and that its are highly mischievous, and detrimentalinterest of mankind. In saying this, we en aquit its authoress, Mrs. Stowe, of any evil any wicked feeling, or intended falsehood.The lady, for all we know, may be a most excellentas she is undoubtedly a very talented person.To fully give her credit for good motives; we but that she believes herself entrusted with, as much as ever did any 'eminent fe-, from Maria Leczinska to Johanna South-.  We can imagine her to be endowed with an sense of womanhood, and to make—if ever condescended to such task, since the second of her book was sold—about the worst that were over placed upon a dirty ta- in a slovenly parlor. We can imaginethat she writes a big scrawling hand, with the letttersall backwards, avoiding neatness with painstakingprecision.  Her voice is probably harsh, her imposing, and she will, or does, wear her grey hair in the mother-of-a-nation style. we think it a great pity that she did not do rather than what she has done, with all busy enthusiasm of a woman in breeches.Then some time ago, long before the work was in England, we chanced to make it up in the of an American friend, we stumbledupon a passage of the first force in cant and non.  It was in the style of those anti-slavery, coast-blockade tracts, which we rememberabounded some years since, and which assisted to destruction so many brave Englandseamen, and cost the lives of so many unhappy. For it is our deliberate opinion, that crime, abomination of every kind, loss of life misery, have been caused, by our intervention, the negro race, than thrice the number of years have witnessed, had slavery been still the of Europe and all America, and been allowed a full swing throughout the whole civilizedworld. To avoid our cruisers, what forced marchesand confined stowage have been adopted! Howmany unfortunate blacks have been killed by our and round shot. How many put out of the to lighten the flying slaver, or avoid detection!While we, the philanthropists, have furnished the monarchs with arms to take them captive— guns, pistols and cutlasses to hunt the unfortunate wretches, for whom hypoc- prays, while neglecting the Hindu and starving the white man! Philanthropy, too, sweetensher tea with slave-grown sugar, a halfpenny ayard cheaper, refined by negro blood, at the expense of West India proprietors. How is the cottonmissed, let us ask, that supplies the raw material for the white slaves of Manchester! All such a woman never thinks of, and if she hear cannot understand. We will be bound there peg in Harriet's head, whereon to 'hand an. She sips her tea and cries aloud, 'Ishe not a man and a brother!' But this is pardoned.We cannot excuse the Duchess of Sutherland,and all those fine ladies round whom thousands of their fellow-countrywomen toil unaided-the daughters of consumption, whose threads of are woven into the trumpery lace adorning the bosom of female philanthropy at a draw.  What are Hood's poems compared toUncle Tom's Cabin!  Nothing.  Wretched inconsistencyof conduct! Miserable contradiction ofempathy.  What tears must angels weep at thesefantastic follies of mankind! Uncle Tom's Cabin                                                   Uncle Tom's Cabin! However, we are straying from our intention.To maintain that this one-sided representation is mischief between Great Britain and theUnited States, which nothing can remedy, no treatise no statesmanship hereafter avoid. say that the sickly interference of our fine ladiesmany, nay, most of whom would shrink fromthe contact of a dying needlewoman on their door- and daily pass unheeding the miseries of of white women, is an excess of follyand hyprocrisy, that will be the curse of freedom that the world. We question the motivesof these ladies. Among them we see the names of not renowned for matronly virtues, but notorious for vanity, frivolity and fashion—that com- word, which includes so much socialevil.  On the stage, this work, aided by the moraltalen of its adapters, and the exquisite clevernessof such actors and actresses as are now an Adelphi audience, is doing a mis-which a century cannot repair. Let the Lordcertain look at this. We are playing the partof the despot and the priest, by insulting the UnitedStates of America. What have we to do withthe internal affairs of the American Republic!Why are we to back this great exaggerated LIE?Let the Americans send out here, and write a book shall tell the truth—ay, one half the truth,of London city; let them get up a drama, whosetime shall be in Lancashire; let them make out to be task-masters, without one redeeming over the emasculated millions of British work-people, whose sinews they stretch, and whose bonesmay grind down in the name of commerce. Letthem send to India or Borneo. Let them drama- Warren Hastings and Rajah Brooke. Let them light on the Outram business, with its oppressionand poisonings, together with the false- of suppression and assertion on the part ofthe East India Company. Let them paint faminein Ireland. For each American Legree, they shall an English one. We forced slavery on theAmericans. We are now sowing there the seedsof dissention, broad-cast. We do not admit thatthe state of the negro slave is anything like what itis pictured to be in Uncle Tom's Cabin, in anycase.  There may be solitary cases approaching itin abomination. But the Americans, abolitionistsor not, shall and will get rid of slavery as theyplease themselves, and every thing done in Englandeither sentimentally or not, only adds forceto opposition. Mrs. Stowe has libeled her countrymen:let them look to that. England need notback her with Holy-well-street ignorance and ExeterHall cant. If she do, she will sow the windand reap the whirlwind. Every American in Londonis disgusted with the Uncle Tom mania here.If he go to a theatre, he is insulted and shocked.The English people, on the other hand, are deludedinto the falsest notions of America. When theslave in the drama escapes into British India, thereis a cheer. That cheer may cost us some day ourbest alliance. At this moment, the interests ofEngland and America should be one. Why do notEnglish ladies interfere no behalf of the enslavedFrench people! We believe, on the other hand,that Louis Napoleon is popular with them. IfEngland interfere with American slavery, she willnot effect her object, but the result may be, erelong, that she will be enslaved herself. We haveno patience to pursue this subject further. Thebook is false in fact, as the fine ladies are false insentiment. The good and the evil to be done bythis excitement on our part are in comparativeforce and reality as an Adelphi audience, comparedto the tears of blood that are shed by nations.This intervention will be indeed accursed. Butwhy should it exist! Simply because we are peacestrickenhypocrites. Thaddeus of Warsaw did notcause us to interfere on behalf of Poland. YetMiss Porter's work was not overdrawn, and in merithow immeasurably superior to Uncle Tom's Cabin!Alas! that the following verse should be so likelyto receive an interpretation by such means! TheDevil, in the likeness of Haynau, is addressingLord Palmerston in a farewell letter:—           this.        Uncle Tom's Cabin Thaddeus of Warsaw Uncle Tom's Cabin! May the negroes yon strive to set free,Forge the chains of a deadlier hateThan the world has had eyes yet to seeIn the gloom of a proud nation's fate;Be your shopkeepers ruin'd, your commerce fast bound,And your people by taxes and steam-engines ground;May philanthropists sense you, and Mammon confoundThat which once was a free land.        Yes, we are cutting our own throats with thishypocritical, lying sympathy. Let British ladies,if they want a safety-valve for their hystericalemotions, as well as a means of notoriety, form acommittee for the emancipation of the monkeyswhich afford them so much amusement on Sundaysin the Zoological Gardens. A most touching anda more truthful work than Uncle Tom's Cabinmight be written on the sufferings of these; while,politically, it would be harmless. No! They haveno occasion to invent, any more than to borrow,an opportunity for the exhibition of their Christianfeelings and charity. Emigration and death havestifled the groans of Ireland. Let them aid vulgarmisery at home. Let them visit the homes of thecommon English poor. Let them pay their governessesmore than £20 a year. But in the nameof nations and mankind, of liberty and hope, oftheir own truth, safety, honor and salvation, letthem, as well as the rest of the British public,pause and consider well, before they range themselveson the side of the violent American abolitionists,and betray by folly the cause they are stillright with their hearts alone to advocate; or itmay be the worse for them, as well as for slaveryand England. Uncle Tom's Cabin Christian vulgar common In conclusion, the Americans will themselves,ere long, put an end to slavery in the whole of theUnited States. That is certain as that there is asun in the heavens. But they look with a naturaljealousy on our interference, and we think they arequite right to tar and feather any impudent fellowwho shall presume on their soil to dictate to theircitizens. And we sincerely hope, that if thearistocratical fine ladies, with their female coterieof toadies, whose names we have seen so prominentlyput forward in a manner, considering all thevarious circumstances of the case, offensive to truthand decorum, should transmit their resolution ortheir address, or whatever they please to call it, totheir transatlantic sisters, that it will be met eitherby a stern rebuke or the silent contempt it merits.We who say this have as great an abhorrence ofslavery as any one, but we cannot forget how shorta time it is since England was herself foremost inthis human traffic. Nor can we forget that it ischiefly encouraged by the British nation now. Wereceive the stolen goods. The Brights and Cobdensof the present day were actual slave-owners but afew years ago. They are indirect slave-ownersnow, and what they are as white task-masters, letOastler and Ferrand tell the indignant generationthat is springing up, inheritors of their evil deeds.For the age of humbug must cease, or the reign ofEngland must be over. Let these silly dames,from her Grace of Sutherland down to Mrs. BarryCornwall Proctor, be taught these things. Herelet us observe, that this is not the voice of Englishwomen any more than dramatised Uncle Tom'sCabin is the voice of English men. And beforeany body of British matrons or maids shall dare tosend over their hollow condolence, or their trashysympathies, to the maids and matrons of theUnited States, we would pray for an inquiry intotheir individual lives and conduct, to see whetherthey are fit persons to communicate any expressionof national feeling—granting for a moment that itis national feeling, and not a spurious effort atnotoriety on the part of a few idle aristocrats andmeddling blue-stockings, leavened with a score ofMrs. Nicklebys, scarcely to be held responsible fortheir folly. Before they thus stand conspicuouslyforward as philanthropists, we should like to knowwhether, as wives and mothers, and daughters,they have no blot on their character, no stain ontheir conduct. Are they all without reproach intheir homes! Are they all respected and belovedby their servants, their tenants, their tradesmenand their friends! Have they individually shownpiety and good-will! Are they true sisters ofcharity and mercy! Are none of them scandalmongersand mischief makers, odious at once bothin the domestic circle and the social throng! Ifthis can be all well-established in their favor, thenhave they a right to speak publicly—in a bettercause. Yet, again, why do not these women, ifthey most be busy, contribute, like the Romanwomen of old, to the defences of their country!The day may come when they shall oven sorrownot to have done this! will coterie Uncle Tom'sCabin To return to Uncle Tom's Cabin, it is true that wederive it from an American woman. To her ownpeople she is accountable, let not us be her sponsors.What a picture might be drawn of England forAmericans to hail with rapture, read, dramatise,weep over, and memorialise upon, were Sloanegiven as toe type of the British bar, or the manwho roasted a live cat the other day in presence ofhis wife and a friend, as a fair sample of the middleclasses. Thus Cannon, the sweep, might representthe feeling of the lower classes; Mr.Oliveira the dignity of the House of Commons;Mr. Prynne should be a sample of oar Church;Lord Frankfort of the nobility. In this manner,what a truthful, pleasant novel might be composedto present an English parallel to the socialphenomena exhibited in such attractive, becauserevolting details, in that most successful and heartrendingpublication, Uncle Tom's Cabin.
