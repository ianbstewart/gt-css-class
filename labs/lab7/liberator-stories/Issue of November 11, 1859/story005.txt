 Our special Richmond despatch informs us that ithas been decided on by the Virginia authorities tohand over Cooke—John Brown's lieutenant —to betried by the federal court in the Harper's Ferry district.The object of this is to have Seward, Greeley,Sanborn, Wilson, Hale, Forbus, Gerrit Smith, andall others who were implicated in the conspiracy, orwho are known to have been in the secrets of theconspirators, subposnaed as witnesses, and placed onthe stand to tell all they know in the matter. Theyare outside the jurisdiction of the Virginia Statecourts, but not of the federal courts. Gerrit Smith, it sceme, was anxious, after thefailure of his 'Kansas work,' to unburthen hismind and make a fall statements of the public, confessinghis own connection with the Harper's Ferryoutrage, and showing up the part taken in it by allthe black republicans and abolitionists of New Yorkand New England; but his friends restrained him,and induced him to keep quiet. If the plan intimatedby our Richmond correspondent be carriedout, the Peterboro' philanthropist will have a legitimateopportunity afforded him of telling 'the truth,the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.' We do sincerely hope, therefore, that the federaland the Virginia authorities will arrive at a promptunderstanding on this matter, have Cooke put ontrial before a district Judge of the United States,and process issued to compel the attendance of allpersons in this section of the country whose nameshave been associated with the traitorous and murderousacts of Onawatomic Brown. We will themknow to what extent Seward, Sumner, Smith,Lawrence, Greeley &CCo., were aideres and abettorsin this villainous conspiracy. Hurry up the indictment!—New York Herald. New York Herald.
