 If events shall prove that Gerrit Smith of NewYork has been accounted in encouraging by his advicesor money the treasonable movement of QusawatomicBrown, we know no reason why he shouldnot be punished with all the severity the law demands.He has been accounted a man of pure andnoble impulses and philanthropic purposes; but ifhe has been led by his haten or by his devotion toone idea into the company of misguided and oriminalmen, be cannot hope to escape the consequence ofhis act. He has no political affiliations with theRepublican party; and, if prosecuted, will doubtlessrely for defenders upon Democrats whom he has ineffect appeared anxious to scrve. When he act himselfup as an independent candidate for Governor ofNew York, because the Republicans did not come upto his requirements on this slavery question, he becamean active and open enemy of the party; andas such has been constantly treated. His warmestpersonal friend is Mr. Douglas of Illinois. Whenlast in this city, he was the Senator's guest; and hislast speech made here was a fulsome laudation ofthat gigantic little man. We look for that gentlemanand the Chicago Times, his hand-organ, to enterupon his defence.â€”Chicago Tribune. Times Chicago Tribune.
