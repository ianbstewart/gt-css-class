 TO THE EDITOR OF THE REPUBLICAN: O THE DITOR OF THE EPUBLICAN SIR,—The July number of the Christian Examinercontains an article from the pen of the Rev.Dr. Peabody upon the slavery question, under thecaption of Narratives of Fugitive Slaves, whichsome one remarks, is a new kind of literature, destinedto occupy no small space among Americanpublications. IR It is curious, and withal quite instructing to anyone familiar with the anti-slavery agitation from itscommencement to the present time, to note the actionof prominent public men, from time to time, assome one or other is impelled by the force of circumstances,his interest, or his ambition, to address thepublic with his thoughts, or apologies, on this all-engrossingtopic. Usually the course is ostensiblyto define their position, and make out a claim tobe classed as lovers of freedom and opponents ofthe slave system of this country; but the true motive,judging from the usual amount of twaddle expended,really is, and intended to operate as a discouragementof all and sundry action on the slaveryquestion at the North,—a dash of cold water uponevery unquiet conscience, and all philanthropic feelingamong us, in view of our responsibilities fornegro slavery. In this respect, the article of Dr. Peabody offersno variety, and substantially reiterates the old pro-slaverycry of non-intervention on the part of theNorth, and recommends only the policy of a 'masterlyinactivity.' The old objection against the radicalabolitionists, of using the King's English legitimately,of selecting the appropriate term to signifythe real fact, is dwelt upon at length, and with anunction, by Dr. Peabody. Hardened men-stealers,and incorrigible sinners, should not be designated assuch, but the phraseology should be sufficiently dilated,softened, and distorted, to suit the fastidioustaste of the offenders. He who is an habitual pickpocketmay, according to universal authority, becalled a thief,—but he who habitually and continuallyrobs men of themselves, of their wives, theirchildren, their responsibilities, and their God; thesewholesale violators of all moral law, and everyChristian precept, must, forsooth, be addressed withgreat tenderness, and with all respect. The greatcrime of slaveholding must be softened and shadedaway, to erroneous opinion and mistaken judgment. The Free Soil party, in consequence of the veryhomopathic portion of anti-slavery which that partyhas imbibed and adopted, excites the Rev. Doctor'sfears, no less then the old out-spoken abolitionists.Hands off, all you gentlemen of the North, you onlyembarrass the real anti-slavery workers of the South,who, by the way, exist only in the Doctor's imagination,or if they do, have as yet given no visible signof life.  In answer to the question, 'by whom is the workto be done?' Dr. Peabody says—'It becomes obviousthat the burden and heat of the day is not to beborne by "gentlemen at case," who make speechesin Faneuil Hall or the Tabernacle, nor by membersof anti-slavery societies, nor by any persons at theNorth.' 'If slavery is to be removed, it must be atthe final stage through legislative action in the slaveStates, and over this, the inhabitants of other Stateshave only a slight indirect influence.' 'How, then,are we to regard the friends of freedom at the South?They comprise the only class of anti-slavery menwhose existence is absolutely vital and essential tofreedom,' 'Freedom can dispense with the effortsof all others, but not with these.' Dr. Peabody continues—'One of the questionable things—whetherit has or has not compensating advantages, we donot pretend to say—about the Free Soil party is, wefear, its tendency to cripple the friends of freedomin the slave States' It arrays section against section,the North against the South, and the Southernman who is opposed to slavery, feels compelled, byall those social instincts, which are more powerfulthan our reasonings, to unite with his neighborsagainst what seems to them all the organized aggressionof strangers.' We have made a lengthy extract, and it comprisesthe sum and substance of Dr. Peabody's philosophyand policy of emancipation. Is it the true philosophy—is it the right policy—is it the manly, Christianaction, that is demanded of us here at theNorth! These are questions which the time and occasiondemand of every than an answer, carefully sought,honestly considered, and manfully expressed. To answer  questions understandingly andcorrectly, to decide weather the anti-slavery agitationhere at the North has retarded or hastenedemancipation, and of course our duty in relationto the whole subject, it is necessary to extendour view over the period of the past thirty years,and compare the feelings and opinions, both hereand in the slave States, on the slavery question,then and now. Has any changes occurred in theviews of prominent men, and of the masses, on theslave questions, slave 1689? If so, as I think willbe admitted on all hands, both South and North,what is the primary or principal came which haswrought this change? Let the facts answer.  In 18, the Missouri controversy terminated infavor of the slave power. The North experienced,what on all hands was considered, a Waterloo defeat.The  between slavery and freedomt—will  on the part of the North,and given up  controversy. Thereafter,it was generally  that the slave powershould have its own way in all things appertainingto slavery. Not a  slavery was publiclyuttered, from our out of the country to theother. The whole , than  years,was, by licit convent, left to the providence of God,and the chapter of accidents, as for no the Northwas conceived. The doom of slavery was considered on the country, past all . Thiswas the  of the nation till 1831,  and after that. What is the prevailling  ofthe lovers of freedom, and the ing fear of thesupposes of  I need not say at this time:no intelligent  of the North,  that is  long be  at the South,  do not point to the 'As a of the nation up to out this, or .                                In ,advocated it,—and taed, had How is it now? Wpolitician, the statesmen of the of slavery, and however hypocritical of these dignitaries, are put forth by the shows the state of the a virtue if you have it  by ambitious                 Now, what has sentiment—driven the former positions, and brought into action a  the laborer of power and public men and parties under a sufficient  forgood behavior! Are we indebted to Henry Clayin this matter, the author of the Missouri compromise?The last we heard from him previous to hisrecent latter to Richard Pindell, was in the UnitedStates Senate, where he emphatically' and ex his opposition to any scheme of whatever, either gradual or imm. New the church or political parties been instrumental ining this change in public sentiment; but on thecountry, politicians and  of every handedgrade have uniformly striven to quell and put this rising spirit of anti-slavery among the people.No—to  of these can honestly be laid the unbilityof the prevalence of an anti-slavery feelingand action throughout this land;  theseimpracticable, outspoken anti-slavery men and ,who first raised the standard of immediateemancipation—the duty of the slaveholder, and theright of the slave.                   To those 'gentlemen of case' who make speechesin Faneuil Hall and the Tabernacle; and mightyeasy no doubt it was to make speeches in the of furious make, thinking for the speaker's ,and under this has of uncial degradation, as was thecase throughout the free States in 1825 and 18.And the  were the unvarnished declaration,that slaveholding was sinful, and slaveholders andtheir chatters were culpable sinners.     H and unpalatable as the doctrine was, experiencehas shown that it was eminently the doctrinesfor the case.  But the Free Soil movement will embarrass thefriends of freedom in the South, Dr. Peabody says.Indeed! but this is a very silly assertion, wholly andutterly at variance with reason and the facts of thecase. The friends of freedom in the South, (ofcourse I exclude Western Virginia, Kentucky,Tennessee and Missouri,) if they have yet any existence,are the feeblest of all feeble minorities, whoare so completely smothered by the majority in theSouthern States, that they have yet to utter the firstnote of freedom, and who are so wholly dependentupon the success of the Free Soil party at the North,that they never will speak out for freedom andemancipation, unless Free Soil principles triumph atthe North. They are at present as friends in thebeleaguered citadel, too few to influence action, andmust eventually be overcome, unless effectually sustainedfrom without. The friends of freedom atthe South, if any such there really are, cannot yetmove a finger in the cause of emancipation, againstthe overwhelming odds that surrounds them. The actual truth of the whole matter is, that it isto the free States first, and principally, that we shallbe indebted, if at all, for the peaceful overthrow ofslavery; our hope is in the healthy and vigorousNorth, and not in the diseased and fettered South,For all the primary and principal steps, to rid thecountry of the burden, the wrong, and the disgraceof negro slavery. If any thing were wanting, aside from its intrinsicevidences, to prove that the Whig and ultra conservativepredominates to the exclusion of the moralistand the patriot, in this article of Dr. Peabody, aneditorial in the Boston Atlas, stuffed to overflowingwith fulsome adulation and honeyed phraseology,would alone be sufficient to condoms it, in the estimationof honest and candid men.
