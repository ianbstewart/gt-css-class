 DEAR GARRISON: EAR ARRISON I arrived here this morning. Found all the preparationsmade for a Convention, in an orchard, undersome glorious old apple trees. I am here on theplatform, under the shade of the trees, so thick, thatscarce a ray of the sun, now shining most brilliantly,can penetrate it. It is a sweet spot, and before meis a goodly number, gathered here from twenty milesaround. Resolutions have been offered, and are nowunder discussion. Oliver Johnson is making a statementrespecting West India emancipation: One ofthe resolutions is as follows: Resolved, That slavery is a violation of the naturallaws under which we exist as social beings, andthere is no power in the universe competent, justly,to authorize its continued existence for a single hou.  The sentiment is deeply rooted in the Americanheart, nurtured and strengthened there by the Americanchurch and clergy, that if God nations slavery,it must be right to hold slaves. The resolution was introducedto meet that sentiment, and to  thetruth, that no power exists that is competent to makeit right for one man to hold mother as a slave, or inany way, to violate the fixed and just laws of ourphysical and social natures. The arguments is GOD SANCTIONS SLAVEHOLDERS; THEREFORE IT MUSTAS RIGHT; therefore a slaveholder may be a just andhonest man. How do they learn that God ctionsslavery? (1) From the Dibts. (2) From Providence.Says the Rev. Bishop Meads, of Virginia—'AlmightyGod hath been pied to make you slaves here, andto give you nothing but labor and poverty in thisworld, which you are obliged to alt to, as it is hiswill that it should be so.' Rev. J.C. Postell, atSouth Carolina, in 1836, d of slavery—'It is amerciful visitation;' 'it is the Lords doings, and marvellousin our eyes;' 'it is a divine appointment.'In 1843, Rev. Wm. Wis, D.D., in the GeneralAssembly, said—'I have been shocked when my abolitionbrethren have told me, if they thought theBible tolerated slavery, they would reject the Bible;but I dare not take this liberty with the Bible. IfGod tells me to lay my wife on the altar, it shall bedone.' in a sermon by Rev. G.W. Freeman, ofNorth Carolina, in 1836, he says—'Slavery, as it existsat the present day, is agreeable to the order ofdivine providence.' In 1849, Rev. Joel Parker, D.D.,said—'God, by an wtable providence, hascasual several millions of the black ra of Africa tobe dispersed through Christian nations; ** theyare new at school in Christian, preparing to carrythe gospel into Africa.' if God nations slavery,it must be right to hold slaves.   OD SANCTIONS SLAVEHOLDERS; THEREFORE IT MUSTAS RIGHT        ** I might quote, to any extent, from the priests ofall sects, to establish the fact that what they worshipas God has, as they and the churches everwhich they rule, believe, made known through thisBible and Providence that he sanctions slaveholding.Thus the being who is enthroned and worshipped asGod by the religionists and politicians of the republic,is the founder and protector of American Slavery.It is certain it same into existence, and has been perpetuatedto this day, under his auspices. In his and by his authority, the oppressed of the runs werebrought to this country, sold, enslaved, and need ochattels. Thus slaveholders and their allies and abettors,in Church and State, of every name, have suitedupon the reverence universally felt for the nameand character of God, and made it subserve the purposesof slavery. The popular opinion is that justie,equity, truth, humanity, purity, goodness, doaffection, and all the natural relations and obligationsof man to man, must go down before the authorityof God; that God is competent to anmi all thatis good, and set up all that is evil, by  slavery.Precisely become, in my view, God is love,and justice, goodness and wisdom, therefore I do not believethat he has any right or power to authorize thecontinued existence of slavery for  moment.Therefore, I most the argument  the Bible andfrom Providence, is fares of the honesty and respectabilityof the slaveholders, by saying whatever declaresslaveholders to be good and himself man, andthat slaves owe one moment's obedience or survive totheir m as that they ought to be contented intheir condition as slaves, never same from the sourcesof truth, justice and goodness, but did,  iserror and ignorance, or injustice, , orwickedness.            the church and clergy say, if they Bible slavery, their  not take the liberty to say the Bibleis . I  sympathise with                    The church and clergy say that the although  two wasy to the  that slavery would be right . If the Bible d that I I had  upon, would Laughs the poin. As no go to that back to learn the right or wrong ofslavery. That church and clergy is allying that backto their m, pollution and , in the of slaves, are doing all they can to make it' theours  of mankind. There are  untilvillainies which  power in the universe  and virtues. Slavery is out! Theauthority of a back against the authority of a hell,must go damn.                         As to 'Providence,' as a proof of God's tionof slavery, L it as power against facts asthe Bible, Slavery exists—this is a fact! and, if thisbe all that is meant by a 'mysterious providence' Ihave nothing to say. I have as little revthat providence that enclaves man, as I have  thatwhich causes man is lie, got drunk, step and no more. That Reversed Bishop Meade gravely ensuresthe slaves that 'Almighty God made themslaves, and given them nothing but labor and povertyin this world.' The slave should be taught to lookthat Bishop Meade in the face, and as gravely andplainly say to him—'Your almighty God, is to mean almighty fnd; he had no business to make me aslave, and give me nothing but labor and poverty inthis world; I will not submit to him, but proclaimeternal opposition to him, as a monster of injusticesand cruelty.' If the oppressed of this land, and alltheir friends, would thus must those impudent andblasph appeals to God to sanction the conductof slaveholders and their abettors, they would seenbe silenced. It is my glory and my boast that I aman atheist to what slaveholders and their allies worshipas God. They build temples, organise churches,make prayers, sing psalms, and perform their devotionsto a demon worse, if possible, than Moloch orJuggernaut; for, themselves being witnesses, theyworship as God the personification of all the crimesthat go to make up slavery and the slave trade. Ouronly hope of becoming true worshippers of Him whois love, justice, truth and goodness, is to becomeathletes to what slaveholders and their religious andpolitical tes worship as God; and who isshe almighty  of their size, and their no lessalmighty bail against turning 'fugitive and vagabondsin the earth,' which they have fattened withtheir brother's blood.            bail Dear Garrison, such thoughts are forced upon meevery day by the pro-slavery religionists and politiciansthat I encounter. My head and my heart areever on fire with them. I must write them as well astalk them. I put them down as in my journal, and all the better to write them to you. Pardon mefor standing so much of my scribblings. Publish onlywhat you see fit, and hand the rest to R.P.W.,to keep for me.  We have had a glorious Convention. It is pervadedby a stern and uncompromising spirit as youwill see by the resolutions that passed unanimouslyand heartily. We have pursued the church and clergyinto their last retreat, i.e., their Bible and theirGod; and the politicians into theirs, i.e., the Union.But the Convention is being adjourned. God be withyou! HENRY C. WRIGHT.
