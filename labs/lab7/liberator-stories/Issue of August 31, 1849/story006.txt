 In the Liberator of the 17th ult. we made copiousextracts from speeches  at various public hold in E and other places in J,for June and July with anti-slavery  and by the  who a few years ago hou any man daring to  such  What changed  The Jo the  of  and theslave  through the world? We must  illustrate of this able t.                          As a g public meeting hold at Meetings BoyMr. Low and —     This, sir, may be called, cotially, an antislaverymeeting, in the language of Mr. D, and it hope in to  in of them who have game before as is able glweek. This  the  of James,                                 may have been their previous vi, the changed regarded by  thinking beenonly of the  of  of constitutionwhich convert the h and a  to a . you will, sin, purinto children, that this is no now pollution tome. I belong the  of  who have for a serof years in  country, b undeserving tooppose slavery in every  and shape had to improvethe condition of the share; and whatever mayhave been our come it the course trust  we are led to one through a different  our motives will be bulyappreci. it is with great pleasure , that Isee you occupying this place. Though I have hadthe honor of becoming acquainted with you onlyduring the past month, I have known for many yearshow gable you have been in las ththe  of Africa. I become as,twenty years ago, sir, with as instance of your in the moral ectitude of a daughter ofAfrica, an offspring of slavery. I did not comehere, sit for the purpose of dealing with the  mariaor agricultural interests involved in this question.My advocacy in of the cause of humanity andjustice, and it will be a pleasing reflection to you,sir, as you my it is the first time you have appedin so public and prominent a manner, that appearancein to sustain the glorious week of humanity,which is so intimately connected with your particularvocation.                                     And slow, sir, recurring to ray resolution, I mustrecommend this meeting to adopt the suggestion itcontains. A million and a half of money is said tobe ded yearly in hping up the British squadronfor the suppression of the slave trade. Thecaptures which that squadron has hitherto trade,have amounted to but four per cost. per annum inthe number of persons stolen from Africa; andwhen you first reflect upon what I have alreadystated, together with the fact mentioned by the Mr. Reid, from Mr. Boston's book, that about twolives and a half are last in procuring are slave, Isay, sir, there is no dealing with this question in anordinary way. In Cuba, the slave trade is wellknown to be a source of considerable gin to theheads of ments there. The Captain-Generalis  from a long but insufficient Not of Gen.Without , and without practical or administrative knowledge, and with nofixed or safe principles ; he is appointedto the government, Sesly has to taken possessionof it, when two or three hundred slaves arrive,for which he reives his big, containing as manyco of gold. Then there arrives another andanother, and then the tru to him became a continuedand abundant source of wealth. The mpocesedacc of so much gold da andseduces the loose principles of the soldier, who conthe first into in his life  an ambuof mostly. He forget at once his military ownand ancient C purity, and becomes the ordidtrea of last and . Amidst all this,what are we to aspect but coand treachery?When man will pursue dishonest co, andno change  be  in their ha, this  ofconduct should be to have nothing to do with them.For mind reaction, I  upon this moving tourge upon the Government of Great Britain to sayto the Spanish and  Government, Ethe virtues  of your trusties, or we shallrefuse to  your pred into our  wrongfrom the  labor of your slaves. With thosere sir, I  leave to propose the                                            This speech was listened to with great attention,and concluded id land cheering.  At a public meeting hell at the Court House, AnBay, (I) on Wednesday, July 4th,—PtrichC.

(Hear, hear.) A  pass was , and I have  it given and returned insome four .

This is a singleinstance; but I could give you a hundred of themanner in which the Cu slave drugs his chainthrough a shout but horrible life. This is the stateof things in a country abounding in ri of equal to any in the world, and not more than twelvehours passage in a  from where we stand.(I call on all who hear me—I call on all Christiansof every denomination, by the city of theircreed—I call on my fellow-subjects of the mefaith, (hear)—by the ancient  of theirchurch—I call on the  of Africa and their descendants,by the blessings of freedom which underthe British Constitution they enjoy—and though lastnot least, I call on that era, powerful in every thing,invincible is good—I call upon each and all fervently,also unidly, to aid as in this good work.

(Muth cheering.) I begMr. Chairman, to more the third resolution—(hear,hear.)

Mr. W. RELL rose to  the resolution, and itpursed unanimously. ELL  Mr. H.J. JACABS being called upon to move them resolution : ACABS   Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gtleman—it so much pleasure, in coming forward to addressing thismeeting, hand as it is on the pure principles of philanthropy,and therefore, equally  uponmen in all situation in  a helping hand in carryingout that great been of humanity, which, if ithad been done in slrity, would have been a tingmonument to the British nation. The subject hasbeen no ably handled by the gentleman who pdedme, that it leaves me little to say; yet callous mustthat heart be, when  to  by the gloriouscause to which there great and good , ChWit Me, and many others, had, with motion, devoted all their  and energyto the  of the glorious act ofemancipation, if it did not vibrate with feelings ofemotion, when called upon to join in, I hope, the finalaccomplishment of the downfall of the most infmoustru that  the earth. I mean, sir,the slave trade, (Cheers.) Where we  theyears that been passed by, when  tru was,questioned by the government, we aled to the conclusionthat much has been ; and had it not beenfor the false policy which has pervaded the Britishgovernment for them hot for years, we would indeedhave had  to re ever the total estimationof this herald tr. That government cannotnow inputs our  to ce, they have  as down to the very verge of ctionand in  of heart do we ,'How have the  fallen!' (Cheers.) I can,Mr. Ch and gentleman, as an the  into the  spi of thismeeting; for when I p or a descendant of who were  hold by bandage by the wished king of the sufferings they were made to of the heavy  that were impand how they were dd by an                     Cheers.                                        My As human nature's , foulest blot,Chains  and  his sweetWith  heart,W whom  on a Them what  what man And having , does not blushAnd hang his  himself a man                    —(Cheers.)—Oh! Slavery, than art a bitter drought!but more bitter still will the stings of conscious beto those by whose acts the chains of the slave aremore firstly riveted than over. (Hear, hear.) Thosemen who, by their wicked and short-sighted policy,have caused, and still cause, thousands of their fellow-mento languish and die in the chains of slavery;those men, sir, who, to save a penny in thepound on sugar, partake of the blood and sinewsof their fellow-men! Out, I say, upon such mawkishphilanthropy! 'tis indeed a bitter mockery of thejustice of the British nation. (Cheers.) The principalsteps, Mr. Chairman, to be taken towards theaccomplishment of this great and noble cause, isthat which we, in conjunction with the other parishes,are now doing. It is our bounden duty, as wellfor our own protection as for the cause of humanity,to call upon the British government to enforce thetreaties made with Spain and the Brazils for the totalsuppression of this nefarious traffic (Hear, hear.)Let petition upon petition be piled upon the table ofthe House of Commons—let the British Governmenthe made aware of the premium she is holding out toslavery, (hear, hear,) and of the deep injury she isinflicting on her own colonies. If these treaties areenforced, we may again hope to see Jamaica regainher pristine vigor, and resume her wonted station asthe queen of the Antilles. (Cheers.) Let us thenjoin heart and soul in this cause—let no petty jealousiesdisunite us in carrying out this great principle—but let us, with one accord, give a long pull, astrong pull, and a pull altogether, for the hurling todestruction this curse of the earth! (Cheers.) Andnow, Mr. Chairman, the following is the resolutionwhich I hare the honor to propose:— Resolved, That this meeting calls upon her Majesty'sGovernment to at once earnestly enforce theterms of the treaties referred to, and thus forever extinguishthe horrid traffic in human flash at presentcarried on; or should such a course be deemed politicallyinexpedient, then we call upon the British Parliamentto exclude from the British market all sugarproduced by slave labor, thereby discontinuing thedirect encouragement given to the man-stealer, andthe enriching of a trade so universally and justly execrated.' Mr. Wm. Dixon seconded the resolution, and it wascarried by acclamation.
