 We have received a letter from our , Mr. as an anti-slavery men, it was justwould not comply with their invitations  of his said that such was the seen and them, in a private way, God-spend in the good of giving freedom to three million of out and helpless people in  would have been gratifying to the did not even deign to reply to their letter, nor offer amood of consolation or encouragement; but allyannounced the Nobel to the suggest of the system of rapine and wrong—during in  he did not know that there was any  against it, and  the whileweight of his religious and philanthropic on the side of the slaveholder's argument. Whatwould the slaveholder ask or desire more than this?Great that the Christian Scriptures do not slavery, and you have given the slaveholder  to perpetuate slavery forever. C himselfcould not ask a larger admission in  of theimpression of slavery, than that so gratuitously madeby this great apostle of temperance. It is on thisaccount that we have felt it to be our du to expressand denounce the conduct of Father Mathew. Hisgreat popularity as a temperature men, and his highstanding as a priest and philanthropist, ght not,and shall not, shield him from the rebuke which hisble and injurious course richly m. Ifan angel from heaven should array himself againstthe cause of freedom, and cant his inflection withthe oppressors and tyrants of our land, his lateshould be no better than that of Father Mathew. Oh,when will men learn that there is a God in the universe,and that He cannot look upon sin with anydegree of allowance? When will they learn that theycannot serve God and Mammon, not promote thecause of righteousness in one particular, by sacrificingit in another?                                                           Father Mathew proposes, we understand, to sharethe hospitality of President Taylor. This may be,perhaps, an explanation of his unwillingness 'toco himself' on the subject of slavery—at thesame time that it elucidates the cause of his inabilityto 'see any thing in the Bible against slavery.'—F.D.  himself see any thing in the Bible against slavery.
