 DEAR SIR: EAR IR We have not yet—I write on Thursday, the 29thof June—heard that the French army has enteredRome. Their General is daily iing laudatory accountsof the progress he is making in the work ofdestruction, and the Roman Tria and the Romanpeople are showing how much the spirit of libertyhas such into their hearts and minds, and intothe heart and mind of your friend M moreparticularly. His noble State papers prove how worthyand excellent are the principles he owes. I havelong known how noble and good a man he is; andwhen you met him here, you had some opportunityof witnessing his knowledge, and informing the energyof his mind, by the clearness of the views of right,and consequent duty; and the earnestness withwhich he espoused them.    Our daily press here is sewing disgust in the mindsof all who see the nation rise from a state of feudalism,and the people emancipate themselves from atocratisthraldom, by peaceful means. The 'Tnewspaper, which has a monopoly, not red to itby express but by indirect legislation, commonly processfavorable news from the Hunga, andgbles what it cannot keep wholly back, when thenews travels into the country by private letters, as toRome, and the conduct of the French, governmenttowards it. Though the 'Tl' is all god to condemnthe wickedness and grass injustice of L and the other  called republicans,who make the profession of reubli that theymay restore monarchy and detion, yet, whilst doingthe condenatory in a covert way, it takes everyopportunity, not of conbut of condep these who  them to and  principles in . 'What 'has M in  Why should the people be dictated to by  Thus that he is  and that they following him. Who sight has he to , who was not  in  By                                                 ☞day, there are  th thepublic journals of this country the evi of the of the  as a governmentand of the  if the  of so from the  and of their monopolyof the land.

That among there 20,0001 and lordsthe land is no unequally-divided, that  of them,in this M island, hold thousands of t, whilstthe  of them hold smaller properties, from oneor two hundreds, down to one or two. That theyhold, generally speaking, the patronage of the State,and, as magistrates, the administration of justice tothe poor. That they are petty lords in the ruraldistricts, and largely influence the return of all themembers to the Parliament. Add to these things,the working of the law of primogeniture, and thelaw and practice of entail, and you will see howstrong must be the energy of the  that has borneup against such  and made England thepowerful nation which the . All the law-makingand all the government have been in the hands of thearistocracy; we cannot wonder, therefore, at this appallingstatements we daily  of the result of theirmanagement,                 UDSON MONPOON           July 13, 1849. Well, Rome has fallen into the hands of the French,and new will begin their troubles. They (the FrenchGovernment) have  on  iniqui principle,by wicked , and they will yet, as a nation, farthe injurious consequences resulting. It neveryet has been, that wicked means bring round goodresults to those who ;  of a , thisis more esply obvious, because a people do notdie off, though individuals do. At least, nations donot die off so quickly.          The French oldistry have suffered much, and arenew in a attention in which all their will be reused; for the Roman people have been subduedby  to government of po;and they are now appending their dictive passionsby emancipating the poor soldiery whenever theyhave an opportunity of doing so, That it is that thewickedness of government is wished out upon thepeople, and hands it is that the duty upon each manis  to ruhis voice wrongs by this government under which he lives.          If man could  how  this  oftheir government work out injuries upon themselves,they would not be—as they mostly are—as ins their . it is the  of individualsthat lands to  to —that has made itpilly a truth, that governments are  instrumentsof des.
