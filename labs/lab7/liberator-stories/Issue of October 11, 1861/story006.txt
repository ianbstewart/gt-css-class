 Commenting upon an article in the Tribune, favoringthe abolition of slavery by the government, underthe war power, the N.Y. Journal of Commerce says:â€” Tribune Journal of Commerce 1. Anti-Slavery is the primary cause of the rebellion.But for anti-slavery, there would not now be aseceded State, nor a regiment in arms against theUnion. When the Tribune makes it plain thatslavery, an existing, passive subject, is any moreactive than anti-slavery, an aggressive, revolutionaryprinciple, then it might do to tell men that slaverywas more the cause of the rebellion than anti-slavery.It is idle to reason in this manner. Thetruth lies between the two. The responsibility ofthe war rests on extreme men and extreme principleson both sides. Who has the greater share, wewill not now discuss. Anti-Slavery is the primary cause of the rebellion. Tribune 2. True, the Union men of the South are dumb;but proclaim abolition as your war-cry, and theirsealed lips will open in shouts of defiance; you willthereby make every Union man in the Sooth anenemy. 3. Instead of your proclamation weakening theSouthern forces, it would add tenfold to theirstrength. The very fact of our adopting slave insurrectionsas a part of our war material would foreverunite the slave States in a war of self-preservation,whose and we might name of us live to me. We do sincerely hope that the Tribune will recallthis avowal. We search the pages of history andthe revealed word of God, in vain for a justificationof the idea, or a palliation of its atrocity.
