 Gen. Fremont has been ordered to modify hisproclamation in relation to the slaves of rebels, so asto conform to the mere letter of the act of Congressof July, which prescribes that slavesin the rebellion should be forfeited to their masters.Gen, Fremont had taken a common sense view ofthe subject, and ordered the emancipation. of allslaves held by rebels, because, while in the hands ofrebels, they would certainly strengthen the rebellion,and freeing them would as certainly weaken itBut this has so alarmed our chicken-hearted politicians,that they have procured an order from thePresident, requiring this modification. It may notaffect much, as all depends upon the construction ofthe law at last But there is a craven cowardiceabout such an order, at this time, as will stink inthe nostrils of all true seen. It is of no use to minceterms any longer. We are reaching a crisis whenthings should be called by their right names, andmen should speak what they mean. If the Governmentmen is to fight this rebellion. and practice the treasonto itself of sustaining slavery for the rebels,and giving them the aid and comfort of returningall their fugitive slaves, it is time that we shouldknow it, that we may calculate how much of ourblend this Moloch demands as our sacrifice, beforewe can, have peace. Our people will sustain theirflag, at all events; but this requiring of them tosustain the flag for as, and slavery for rebels, is sucha burden as no other Government has ever laid uponits people; and it should be required no longer.Let the people speak, and demand of the President,in tones that will be heard above the voice of themorning politicians who infest the councils of theGovernment with-their intolerable cowardice, thatthis course most coma; and that they shall no longerbe required to make this fearful sacrifice of bleedand treasure to sustain that monster evil.â€”AshtabulaSentinel. for slavery for rebels AshtabulaSentinel.
