 From a telegram, we learn that James Redpath'sJohn Brown meeting, which was called at Boston,on Monday last, was disposed of in a very summaryand appropriate manner. It was monopolizedby the anti-slavery Brown citizens of the place, whochose Richard S,. Fay, Chairman, and passed resolutionsdenouncing Brown, justifying his executionand lauding Virginia. The Abolitionists vainly endeavoredto get a hearing. Finally, the policewere called, and, amid much confusion, the hallwas cleared, and closed up by order of the Mayor,The scene of the next 'wake' will probably beNorth Elba, where unlimited freedom will perhapsbe given these pitiful beings to howl forth theirdismal ditties. At all events, we are gratified tosee that the people of Boston are beginning to lookupon these demonstration in their true character—a public nuisance—a stench in the nostrils of everygood citizens.—Topeka (Kansas) Tribune—BorderRuffian Democrat.
