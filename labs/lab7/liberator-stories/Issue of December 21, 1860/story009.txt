 The Patriot thinks we should hardly dare to sayto the face of the men who broke up the TremontTemple meeting last week, that they were a 'mob.'Why should we not? Does the Patriot mean tointimate that we, too, should he treated to mobargument, in such a case? We don't know howsuch a proposition strikes others, but to our mindit savors strongly of Austrian despotism and thelaw of the bludgeon; and yet this is a fair inference,from the Patriot's article. An to our having sympathywith the Temple Meeting, that is a slanderand a calumny. We have no desire to canonizeJohn Brown or any of his gang; but the meansemployed to break up that meeting were disgracefulto the actors, and if any man of Cape Codorigin wan engaged in it, we are very sorry tolearn the fact. They were not obliged to go to themeeting; but when they were there, they had noright to outrage free speech by such proceedings asthose which we have commented upon. The Patriotought to be ashamed of itself for countenancingor defending such miserable business.â€”YarmouthRegister. Patriot Patriot Patriot's Patriot YarmouthRegister.
