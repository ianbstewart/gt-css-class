 The telegraph brought news of the breaking upof a meeting of John Brown sympathizers, whohad gathered in Boston to celebrate the anniversaryof his death. We are told that those whowere foremost in breaking up the meeting were of'the highest respectability'—men of wealth andstanding. And many Northern journals countenancetheir acts, and stigmatize the meeting as oneof ' dangerous fanatics. 'But what of that? Whatif the movers in the meeting were Abolitionistsand Garrisonites? Have not they a right to freedomof speech? And who is to be the arbiter?who is to decide whether or not a man is too fanaticalto be allowed to hold to his own views, andpromulgate them too, if he can influence others tobecome his followers? These things are done inthe South, and we all cry out against it as a wrongand a tyranny; in how much do the motive andthe principle differ, when put into practice in theNorth? Suppose a meeting was celled in Cleveland,of all whose sympathies were with the secessionistsof the South, is there a decent Republicanjournal that would advise or countenance any bodyof men, however ' respectable,' in breaking up thatmeeting by force? And if freedom of speech is tobe allowed to one, why not to all? Whether themeeting is unwise or not affects not the principleof free speech. We care not whether the intrudingparty upon the meeting at Boston was composedof millionaires or beggars it was a mob,and as much, deserving the execration of the wholeNorth.—Cleveland Leader.
