  U.S. CONSTITUTION IS 'A COVENANT WITH DEATHAND AN  WITH '    ☞'Yes! IT CANNOT BE —the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of their to the Constitution, three special provisions TO THE  OF THEIR INION OVER THEIRSLAVES. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African slave trade; the second wasTHE STIPULATION TO SURRENDER FUGITIVE SLAVES—allengagement positively prohibited by the laws of God,delivered from ; and, thirdly, the exaction, fatalto the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor SLAVES—for articles of merchandise, underthe name of persons . . . . in fact, the oppressor representingthe oppressed! . . . To call government thus constituteda democracy, is to insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slavery. Its reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of the nation is to establish an artificial,majority in the slave representation over that of thefree people, in the American Congress; AND TO MAKE THE PRESERVATION, PROPAGATION AND PERFETUTIONOF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANIMATING SPIRITOF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT'—John Quincy Adams.
