 Another of the disastrous consequences of uncalled forreference with the institutions of othercommunities, appears in the recent action of theCherokee Territorial Legislature. For a long seriesof years, while the missionaries have been permitted,among them and other tribes, to pursuetheir labors undisturbed by foreign influences, apublic sentiment was gradually growing up, whichwas working the removal of slavery from the midstof the Indian tribes. This was the case emphaticallywith the Choctaws and Cherokees. We hadoccasion, last year, repeatedly to speak of the unhappyresults that were transpiring in the midstof the Choctaw people. There we saw stringentlegislation calculated to retard the progress ofemancipation, and to shut out, as for as law couldeffect it, the influence of religious education fromthe minds of the children of the black population.Now we have occasion to record measures in thesame direction pursued by the legislature of thetheir kees. It seems to no impossible for any candid man todoubt, that if the missionary labors among thispeople had been suffered to be pursued withoutreference, and they had been allowed, accordingto the light of the Word of God, and their ownread judgment, to adopt those measures and topresent those views of truth which appeared tothem best fitted to promote the glory of God, andthe highest interests of the semi-civilized peoplesamong whom they were called to labor,—that thecondition of the few slaves among the Indianswould have been gradually ameliorated, and thatthe evil of slavery would have been removed assoon as was consistent with the best interests ofall concerned. When, therefore, we find thatLegislation among these tribes is taking anothercorrection, and is looking to the perpetuity ratherthan to the removal of the system of slavery, it isimpossible for us, and we think it equally impossiblefor any others concerned, to point to anycauses for the unhappy retrogression, except in thejudicious attempt of those who endeavored tohasten results which cannot be precipitated withoutdisaster. Therefore, however much we regret that the Indianatribes should employ their early legislation tooppose the elevation of those under their power,we feel that they are not so much to blame as themen whose rash counsels have instigated the Indianato such opposition. The following act was lately introduced into theirTerritorial Legislature, and was passed, but weare happy to learn that it did not become a law,having been vetoed by the chief.  Whereas, The Cherokee people are, and havebeen for many years, a slaveholding people: andwhereas the Constitution and Laws of the CherokeeNation recognize the Institution of Slavery,introduced and taught by their preceptors, thewhites; and whereas, some of the missionarychurches now situate in this Nation have expelledsome of our Cherokee citizens from the participatesof church privileges, because they refused toemancipate their slaves, and others have beenthreatened with expulsion; and whereas, the Cherokeepeople, deeply impressed with a feeling of gratitudetowards the name missionaries, for the countlessand manifold blessings which they have beenstowed upon them, would not extend to them anycivilities unbecoming to Christian people, butwould rather, as they value the stability of theirlocal institutions, indispensable to their prosperityas a nation, extend to them the cordial hand offriendship, consistent with their own national interests— Be it enacted by the National Council, That theCherokees have claimed for many years past, andto whom at present, to be a slaveholding people ina Christian-like spirit.
