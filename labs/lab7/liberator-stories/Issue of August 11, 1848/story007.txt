 The second report of the evidence taken beforethe Slave-trade Committee is now published; andseldom have we seen so general a concurrence andweight of testimony to the effect that the blockadesystem has not prevented, and never can either preventor abate the slave trade, and that It has onlygreatly increased the horrors of the passage and thecruelties of the traffic. It is but another exemplificationof the hopelessness of the struggle with thesmuggler, with the temptation of an enormous profit,attended with the shocking circumstance that thecontraband commodity to be packed in the smallestcompass is human flesh. The effects of the blockade have been first to increasevery largely the scale of the ventures, as someare sure to be intercepted, the calculation beingthat one cargo out of four or five will cover the lossof the rest, and yield a profit; secondly, that thedifficulty of shipping the slaves on the blockadedcoast has subjected them to new sufferings andprivations in the depots called berracnons, and insome instances, the shipment appearing impossible,to death, 2,000 having in one case been massacredby their owner, in despair of embarking them, toput an end to the cost of their sustenance; thirdly,an enormous augmentation of the miseries of thepassage, from stowing the unhappy creatures moreclosely in small vessels, and from the scarify supplyof water, to escape the legal evidence of equipment;lastly, a circuitous and longer voyage, toavoid the cruisers, in geometrical proportionincreasing the sufferings and privations Of thevoyage. Against more slaves, more sufferings and death,both on land and sea, what is the set off on Theother hand? In Brazil no diminution of the supply;on the contrary, the significant fact of steadilydeclining prices far slaves fallen in the market sincethe blockade has been in operation, from 75 to40 a man.   At first the Brazilians were alarmed at the schemeof the naval blockade, having exaggerated noticesof the power and capabilities of the British navy;hut as the panic subsided, and their adventurousfelt their way, they acquired confidence, and shapedtheir plans of evasion so as finally to form a completesystem; and they now know perfectly wellthat, if the blockade shuts up certain points, it opensother issues for the traffic, and that the  is,—no matter in what quarter there may be interruptionand failure, and in what quarter the upon andsuccess,—a certain and copious supply of slaves tothe market, the number for the year '47 being estimatedat ,000 But to bring 60,000 to the coastof Brazil, the calculation is that 100,000 must havebeen taken from the shores of Africa, that in, 40,000must have  at sea, But  into accountanother portion that may have been destroyed beforethe shipment of their fellow sufferer.     A must removable witness is Mr. Jess Cliffe,M.D., a marine of the United States, lad in thezils, and for some time engaged in the slave.    Mr. Jo Cliff, it seems, made large profits bythe slave made, and when he had sufficiently filledthe  to afford a conscience, he felt such are to the sufferings and destruction ofthe p to the  traffic that he shapit. Notwithstanding the  of hismutually, the  of his humanity to his Mr. Jess Cliffs is a  shamed and not what he has upon, he , and he has a  of the address and .                   At this moment he pronounces the slave tradethe moat lucrative one under the sun, and of thecounteracting exertions of our gallant squadron hesays, 'They are doing everything that men can dowith the mistaken view which they have of attemptingto do an impossibility.' attemptingto do an impossibility. Mr. Jose Gliffe's account of the sufferings ofthe slaves on the passage is absolutely sickening In answer to the question whether, when packed'like herrings in a barrel,' they suffer from bruises,he states— When they are first put on board they dobruise; but afterwards they become so emaciated,and are so light, that the bruising is very trifling.' but afterwards they become so emaciated,and are so light In reply to a question put by Mr. Gladstone, asto the way of feeding the living cargoes packedclosely in layers, lying on shelves, as it were, oftenonly sixteen or eighteen inches deep, Mr. Jose Cliffsnaively answered. If I were to speak the truth, it would be this: Thevessels are so excessively offensive that it [servingout of the food] is perhaps the greatest punishmentto which you can put any person on board. Thereis some half-witted person whom they generally havealmost on purpose for it, to pass the foot round tothem, and he is in such a hurry in doing it, thatthose who are nearest to one of the hatchways aremore likely to get a double portion of food, ratherthan that he should go round the sides of the vessel,which is so ill ventilated that it produces a sickeningeffect upon him.' If I were to speak the truth is some half-witted person ratherthan that he should go round the sides of the vessel,which is so ill ventilated that it produces a sickeningeffect upon him.' The witness further explained that though 'theHalf—witness person' employed on this loathsome duty,should help each singly, he does not do it, he—cause of the excretive filth. 'He has to get upon a mass of filth, and almostupon a mass of living bodies at the same time, becausethey roll out, and take up everything thatthey can.' The prisoners far from the hatchway frequentlydo not get any portion the rations. The ships upon their arrival are often in so horriblyfilthy a state, as to be abandoned, left to rot,or to be taken by any who would, or could accomplishthe cleansing. In some instances, convictsare compelled to clean them. Mr. Cliffs thus describes the state of the prisonersat the end of the voyage:—' The knee-bonesappear almost like the head of a person; from thearm you may slip your finger and thumb up, themuscular part is gone; it is a mere bone coveredwith a bit of skin; the abdomen is highly protuberant;it is much distended and very large. Aman takes them up in his arms and carries themout of the vessel; they are not capable of walking.They could not stand, even if they were not soemaciated. The muscles have not the power ofsupporting them. The eye has lost its speculation;it has an idiotic appearance—a leaded appearance.It is almost like the eye of a boiledfish. Of course the interest of the slaver is to take allcare for the recovery of the poor creatures, but manyare too far gone to rally. Their sufferings from thirst may he vaguely inferred(imagined it can hardly be) from the factthat a negro will drink a gallon of water a day inhis natural condition, and when packed so closelythat he cannot turn round unless all his fellow—sufferersturn too simultaneously, and with the temperatureat 120 or 130, their allowance is so smallthat Mr. Cliffe shrinks from specifying it,' It is toohorrid almost to say.' He has heard that a teacupfull'once in three days, will support life for twentyor thirty days! It is toohorrid almost to say. The question is, whether we are suppressing orincreasing these horrors. Mr. J.L. Hook, GovernmentSuperintendent of Emigration at Sierra Leone,answers the question, Is the slave-trade nearerextinction now than it was before the (blockade)force was stationed on the coast? I should say'not.' not. He was then asked whether the blockade haddiminished the horrors of the trade. His reply is,'I think, on the contrary, it has very much increased thehorrors of the middle passage.' I think, on the contrary, it has very much increased thehorrors of the middle passage. Captain G. Mansel, R, N., had for some time the'command of the squadron; he has, therefore, hadpractical experience of what it can do, and what itcannot do, and he cannot suspected of any dispositionto undervalue the service upon which hehas been engaged. In answer to the question,whether any naval force could suppress the tradeso long as the demand for supplies exists? he,replied,' I am perfectly convinced if would be impossible.' I am perfectly convinced if would be impossible. As to Capt. Denman's project to blockade thecoast by ships at anchor at certain intervals, Capt.Mansel remarks, 'If you are to keep, upon an extentof const embracing upwards of 2,000 miles,twenty-four vessels at anchor, I leave you to judgehow much of the coast they will leave unguided.'Asked whether he had any hesitation in condemningentirely the employment of a marine force forthe extinction of the slave-trade, he declared hethought it impracticable, and agreed with Clarksonin his fears that an increase of the horrors would bethe only consequence. [After citing other evidence to the same effect,our contemporary continues:—] We shall conclude with the evidence of CaptainStop ford, of the royal navy, who lately commandedH.M.S.' Pearl,' on the Brazil station. He is asked whether, as a naval officer, he is ofopinion that the British squadron will ever extinguishthe slave—trade? His emphatic reply is'Never.' Without much experience of his own in'the slave—trade, he has learnt from the experienceof brother officers the utter hopelessness of theattempt. He was next asked whither the vigilanceof the squadron caused any of the crueltiespracticed? His answer was in the affirmative, thevessels being more crowded in consequence of theblockade system. A moment's consideration will show, indeed,that this must be the effect. As one cargo out offour or five brought to port will cover the loss ofthe rest by seizure, it becomes the obvious policy ofthe slaver to divide his ventures as much as possible,and he will prefer using five small vessels tousing one large ship; and he will then crowd asmany prisoners as can be crammed together, intoeach of the small craft. Mr. Cliffe states, that onevessel of seven tons crossed the Atlantic withthirty-nine slaves on board. A seven ton vessel isa boat about the size of the toys that sail matchesin Chelsea reach. This result was distinctly foreseenby the Duke of Wellington, by Lord JohnRussell, by Mr. Clarkson, by Sir F. Buxton; andyet the system, fraught with consequences antagonistto the object, has been adopted, and is perseveredin, notwithstanding its cruel miscarriage, atan enormous coat to the country.
