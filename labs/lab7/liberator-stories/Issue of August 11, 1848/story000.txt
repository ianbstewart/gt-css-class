Extracts from a Letter addressed to the SouthernDelegates of the Baltimore Democratic Convention,by OVH. On the subject of abolition, I feel that I am asfamiliar which its history, rise and progress, andhave watched it in all its movements, from thedreadful massacre it St. Domingo, down to theattempt to jeopardize the success of our arms inMexico, by engrafting the Wilmot proviso on theTarce Milton Bill as any citizen in the unionIn every paper that have conducted I have defendedthe south against fanatics, and what Wasworse than fanatics political abolitionists and claimto know something of its movements. Their wholeobjects and intention from the commencements,have been to use the slave question as an instrumentsto cripple of not to destroy the political influenceof the South,—they are tried of seeing the peopleof there electoral colleges making choice of southernPresidents and when early all the great menof the revolution in the South had been gatheredto their fathers, the abolitions is set up the Cry, 'thePotomac, the boundary, the negro States by themselves.'It was always a political movement underthe' mask of humanity. There was a time whenthe abolitionists which their well known hostilityto the south were not permitted to hold any publicmeanings in this city, the movement, however, it partookof polluted character, involving votes andadvocated, by that party began to assume a powerfulposition, and boldly announced it intention toagitate the slave question at the South, in orderto create anxiety and apprehension under the suspensionthat the South, alarmed for its safely, wouldrenounce its rights and influence, and contactwith its oppressors for the transfer of its electoralvote to them; something not far removed from this,was not without its influence among the Barnburnersin the adoption of the 'corner stone.'—Under all the persecutions against the South,under all its losses and privations, under the vexation ofStrong their property desponded, and laws utterlydisregarded in the Northern states in the redeliveryof their runaway or abducted slaves, theSouth renamed calm and collected, relying on theirUnited efforts to protect themselves, together witha patriotic dependence on the compromises of theConstitution But these temperate though time proceedingsUnder sever travels in suits and sufferingsmade up on impression on the recusant, democrats ofwas state; their speeches, their presses, their followersall demand tree territory, and that concededto them, their next wanted movement would beto learn does those landmark in the constitution,is on which the South relies for protector. It isthese men who ask for seats in the convention,through southern votes, who are preaching up acrusade against the South, and encouraging fanaticsand political abortionists to raise the incendiaryteach, and endanger the Union, or compel thesuch to come to terms with them. There neverwas a crisis when the South should more firmlystand by its rights, and reject the advanced andpretences of this reputed whig of the democracy;the South cannot yield an inch without danger.What is precedent to-day becomes doctrine tomorrow;a slavish submissive spirit, never yetconquered an enemy. Martin Van Buren's dynastyin the state addends to punish the South for thestand as they call it, of the Baltimore Conventionof 1844; it is for you to say, fellow-citizens,whether you with afford them an opportunity toinflict this punishment upon you, and let me add,upon the country. Let the South, my friend on this importantquestion, keep united; the true friends of the constitutionare to be found in the South, who willnot bend that sacred charter to accomplish political,objects, or advance personal ambition. Onevery occasion the South has stood by the Unionand thee rights and independence of the State andfrom the Revolutionary war to the present momenthis examined the highest evidence of a pure anddisinterested love of country. I am a Northernman and say what know and what I feel of theSouth—its example has always been pure andpatriotic, and I pray on this occasion, this it mayProve true to itself, let, the political consequencesbe what they may. I offer no opinion on the claimssection the several candidates for the Presidency,which will be presented to the Democratic Convention.I recognize in every name, citizens ofintegrity and capacity, under whose administrationthe country will he sale. I entertain no sectionalviews, I go for the Union, and the whole Union,but I feel that the South has been unjustly, ungenerouslyassented in its politic, I rights, and I askthe South to stand by its own principles, and standby its friends. The Alabama resolutions I Considershould be the guide of your deliberations'come what, come may; and it the South cannotat this person secure southern president can atat this period secure a Southern President, it can atleast in nominating a candidate, who is notUnited with hostility to its principles or institutions,or one whose administration will in anymanner endanger the existence to the Union, orparalyze the compromises to the constitution.
