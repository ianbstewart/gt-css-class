DEAR BROTHER:—Accept the following narrativeof proceedings, incidents and observationsconnected with so much of the Anti-Slavery service,as has been rendered by my self and associatesin holding a few of the One Hundred Conventionsresolved on and provided for by the late NewEngland Anti-Slavery Convention at Boston. Itis necessarily crude and imperfect, but cannot hewholly uninteresting or uninstructive to the friendsof this great cause. EAR ROTHER Our field of operations was confined mainly toWorcester County, in which we were directed tocommence what has been called the Westernseries of the One Hundred Conventions. Noseason of the year could have been more unfavorablefor assembling the people of this Country atsuch Conventions that 'Hay-time,' as it is familiarlycalled by our farmers. The urgency of businessthe long warm days, the short evenings, and theusual exhaustion of our best friends, the workingpeople, after a hard day's toil, all operated againstus. The ordinary obstacles to our movement,common to all seasons of the year and all party ofthe country, are formidable enough. We are profoundlyhated by the managers of the popular religioussects and political parties, and as profoundlydreaded by all who are in their leading strings.There is no species of and corrupt conservatismfrom the most industrious to the most Lazy,that is not openly or covertly arrayed against uncompromisingAnti-Slavery. Anything else butlaying the axe to the root of the tree. This cannotbe endured. Every one of these conservativeshas some darling interest', some precious idol,which he insists on preserving; and if slaverycannot he abolished without endangering this, whythen slavery may stand forever. They have tendercorns on their toes which must not be trodden oneven in the attempt to liberate the three millionsof bondmen now grinding in the American prison-house.'Accommodation' is the universal itch ofthis compromising people. In Church and Stateeverywhere they demand accommodation—demandthat their sect, their church, their party, their interests,their prejudices, their ease, be not disturbedIf the abolition of slavery can be advocated,without ruffling their cherished self-complacency,they affect to the quite willing and some of them extremelyanxious for it. Other wise they beg not to betormented before the time, and cry out—'those thatturn the world upside down have come hither also.'Many professed watchmen on the walls of Zion,who stand up as defenders of the church of Christ,appear to deem us more dangerous even than 'thegates of hell,' crying out that we are destroyers ofthe church, and declaring that if we be allowed toproceed, the 'Romans will come and take awaytheir place and nation.' Hence the people arepublicly and privately warned against us; andwhen nothing else will answer, some accommodatingfrom of abolitionism is assumed to pacifytroubled consciences till the old quiet can he restored.Any expedient in the world will answer,that serves to spare them the honest, hearty tug oftearing up the old Upas root and branch. Yet ifwe charge them with being pro-slavery, they feeldreadfully scandalized—having become exceedinglyambitious of a good anti-slavery reputation,while actually confederate with slaveholders, andreally much more troubled at the progress of radicalabolitionism than at the most gigantic stridesof the slave power over the continent. Meantimethere is all over the country a large class of humanbeings who have in themselves no deep moral andreligious convictions. These full in and makeweight just where they expect to find the multitude,or where very strong excitement for the time being,attracts them. They cannot lend. They cannotgo alone. They feel no interest in anything, howevermeritorious, that is not followed by a crowd.Such people will leave all and rush together whenthey expect a great many others to do so. Otherwisethey have no inducement to assemble. If hereand there one should by mistake turn out, we frequentlysee them peeping in at the entry, or perhapshanging about the outer seats of the meetingplace for a few minutes, and then retiring with aclownish tramp, and a significant slam of the door—as much as to say,' we're cheated out of theshow there's no sport here.' Hay-time managers industrious Lazy this Accommodation itch accommodation tormented before the time show Under all these unfavorable circumstances itwas not expected that our Conventions would benumerously attended. Accordingly they have beenthin, ranging variously from twenty-five to onehundred and twenty-five excepting on Sundays,when we have had large and animated assemblies.It has been very gratifying to find everywherestrong and warm hearts, some of them veterans inthe service, others recently enlisted. These welcomedus, and responded cordially to our testimony.And we trust that some others not heretoforeinterested in the cause, were saved from pro-slaveryby the foolishness of preaching the Anti-Slaverycross. In some places we had a formal organization ofthe Convention held, and at others deemed it unnecessary.Sometimes we made use of Resolutionsas our texts, sometimes we chapters from theScriptures, such as the 58th of Isaiah, sometimesof special eases such as that of the imprisonmentsDrayton and his associates, sometimes of particularquestions asked, or objections proposed andsometimes of topics such as are hnarity takenup in lectures and address on the general subject.We took up several collection for the cause, andthe Agents individually received donations for thesame. I received there than enough in this lattermanner to defray all my traveling expenses forwhich due account will be rendered. A considerablefor the Liberator, especially by our darsted fellowlaborer Dr. E. D Hadson Who lead as all is thatdepend most of duty.  On the whole considering all the disadvantagesUnder which we commended this series of theOne Hundred Conventions, I feel a comfortableassurance that we have done well for the causeand accomplished all that could  havebeen expressed of us. Having spoken this muchin general parties I will now other more into detail.  Our first Convention, as you are aware, was appointedat Southboro.' Dr. E.D. Hudson, yourselfand the writer, had the pleasure of meeting eachother there on the afternoon of June 27th. Ourmeetings on that day and evening did not, I think,exceed fifty persons; and you will recollect thatin consequence of the interest taken in the FreeTerritory, Anti-Taylor and Anti-Case Conventionat Worcester, to he hidden on the next day, it wasdecided that Dr. Hudson and myself should attendthat Convention, with a view to witness its proceedingand report them to our friends in Southboro'in the evening. Meantime business called you toBoston. Contrary to our expectations, we ascertained,the next day, while waiting at ton depot fora passage to Worcester, that if we returned before10 o'clock, P.M in the extra train of can, we mustdo so at an hour in the afternoon which would cutus off from witnessing the moat important demonstrationsof the Mass Convention, and so renderour journey thither comparatively useless. Itherefore took the responsibility of advising tocountermand our adjourned meeting for the eveningof the 28th. This was done, and with less detrimentto the cause on account of the rain whichoccurred at the time. We have some devoted anti-slaveryfriends in Southboro'. Among these arethe sawins, the Whitings and the younger Faye,from whom we received every needed attention,kindness mid assistance. Ii is remarkable that amajority of the voters in Unit town signed the Disunionpetition last year and year before, We understandthat the mass of voting citizens have committedthemselves to the Free Territory movement,and that the town is likely in go almost unanimouslywith the new political party. Althoughwe would gladly have do better than this, werejoice that they have conscience and manlinessenough not to do worse better worse The Worcester Convention was a great demonstrationof wholesome popular feeling. More thatfive thousand of the most intelligent, sober, earnest-lookingmen we ever saw assembled at a politicalmeeting, flowed together at a mere call. We didnot see an intemperate man, or a rowdy, or n loaferamong them. We found that the occasion haddrawn out other radical anti-slavery spectatorsbesides ourselves—even the most distinguishedveterans of the cause—all watching the heroscope,and rejoicing in the shadows which coming eventscast before them. While the faithful cannot compromisecannot go back inch to join handsever with those who are advancing toward thegreat line of battle with slavery, they can cheerthem with the animated call, 'Come on, come noIf it is sickening to hear men still muttering idolatrousincantations over tins Federal Constitution andUnion, all foul as they tire with treason to humanrights and perjury to the Declaration of Independence;if it is disgusting to bear men avowingtheir willingness to let slavery alone in the Staleswhere it is crushing three millions of people betweenthe upper and nether millstone of oppression;still those who have renounced all compromisewith thin Hydra can congratulate each other whenthey see so many of their long torpified countrymenwaking up and crying out enthusiastically'Non extension! Non-extension!' because that crywill array against then all the legions of the slavocracy,and compel them to conquer or perish.This Non-Extension party has no alternative. Thepro-slavery army, in dark and cruel battalions, isbefore them, demanding unconditional surrender.Uncompromising Anti-Slavery is behind them, cuttingoff the old retreat of corrupt moral sentiment,and shouting, 'Onward! onward!' So that ifnothing else shall suffice to hold them to the fatalissue, this blessed necessity will. They must surrenderunconditionally to the enemy, or become anultra anti-slavery party, punishing their victories overthe ruins of the Federal Constitution, and even, ifneed he, the Union itself. The result must be, aspaniel submission, or an ultra anti-slavery victory.But whatever the result, thorough-going, moral—power abolitionists have but one course to pursue,i. e. to give slavery no quarter in any of its lurkingplaces, but agitate the moral and religious sentimentof the common people, till such a deep abhorrenceof slavery shall have become general,that no religionist or politician who goes for unionwith slaveholders, will dare to exhibit his foreheadbranded with the 'mark' of that 'beast.  Non extension! Non-extension! necessity will. beast. We saw much at the Worcester Convention toencourage our anti-slavery zeal, and returned toour mission more than ever convinced that Godhath chosen the foolish things of the world to confoundthe wise, and weak things of the world toconfound the things which are mighty.' We considerthe time and money spent in witnessing thatdemonstration well laid out in the anti-slavery,cause. Our next Convention was held at Feltonville,in Marlboro', Thursday and Friday, June 29 h and;30th. We expected our friend Edmund Quincy toaid us in our labors here, but were disappointed.Our meeting took place in the Tavern Hall, andwas at no time large, though in spirit and effectone of the best of the series I have attended. TheBaptist clergyman had done his utmost lo keep usout of his meeting-house, and at the same time tokeep his adherents from attending our Convention.Yet he professes to be an abolitionist, and goeswith the Liberty Party. But he is obviously mushmore anxious lo abolish old-organized Anti-slaverythan he is Southern chattelism. These sectarianLiberty Party abolitionists are everywhere exceedinglybitter against us, and seem ready to resort inany means in their power to prejudice the minds ofthe people. I have found two very different sortsof men in this Liberty Party. One sort honestly,and earnestly desire the abolition of American slavery,a  glad to hear any body expose itsabominations. They have got ingrained into theirimagination that voting is 'the staff accomplishment,'despite the hateful oath to support the Constitutionand laws and therefore cannot stay awayfrom the ballot-box even long enough to get a fairchance to vote slavery down on the direct questionThey differ from us on this point. But they knowthat we are faithful to the slave, and rejoice in ouruncompromising testimony. Moreover, they feelmortified at the tricks and slanders resorted to bysome of their own party to thwart our labors. Theother sort are narrow-minded, selfish, religiousbigots, who, as one of the as recently said, wouldprefer to see the slaves in their chianti's millions ofages, rather than have them liberated by hereticsand infidels—such as Wm. Lloyd Garrison &Co. It is almost impossible to decide in respect toindividuals of this stamp, whether it is spiritual ignoranceand self-delusion, which makes them verilythink they are doing. God's service when they themselves in array against as, or whether it isa conscious, wilful purpose to destroy as. Nor isit important that we should determine this matter,since God alone is to be their judge. It is not the, of their guide bar the  of their with which we have to do. And this weknow, that if all  were  their spiritand follow their example, slavery would never has. For a slaveholder, or slaveholdersapologies, of their own faith and order to, in theirview, incomparably more fit for the fellowship ofthe church on earth or the church in heaven, thanThe purest abolitionist in the world who  their ministry and church for with this gigantic iniquity. Hence weuse such men shamefully affording we have a complianceagainst vowing for else of their own churchcircumstances is civil office,  is Whigor is Democrat. The man is fit for church fellowship, perhaps to be a  as an older,as far a he is a political sinner. Yet though so great a politicalsinner, he is a genuine Christian saint in thechurch. And if we denounces him as a disgrace toChristianity, and his fellowshippers an partakerswith him in the crucifixion of Christ affect beholdwe are Samaritans, and have a devil! We are coalingand devils by Beelzebub, the prince of devils.We are heretics, infidels, blasphemers, and the economiesof all righteousness. But wisdom is justifiedof her own children.                  Samaritans, and have a devil! coalingand devils by Beelzebub It seems to me that such men have little otheruse for their pretended abolitionism than as a backfire to prevent being consumed by the flames ofgenuine abolitionism. And what makes me thinkso is that they never lead off in an anti-slavery agitation,but only exert themselves just enough toquit a disturbed conscience when the real friendsof the slave create a noise about three which cannototherwise be silenced. For an soon as they areleft altogether to themselves they let anti-slaverytake care of itself, and confine themselves moat devotedlyto building up their sectarian and personalinterests. But their sin will find them out, and theday of their judgment will overtake them in duetime. He who truly abhors slavery abhors it alikein Church and in State, in high places and in lowplaces; and he who cares more for his than hedoes for absolute rights , will at last findhimself like the foolish virgins carrying a dark lampwith no oil in it.  Dr. Hudson uttered a stringent denunciationagainst Mr. Wakefield for having warned the peopleagainst us The Rev. Mr. Alger of the UnitarianChurch, thought Br. Hudson unjust and incautioustowards Mr. Wakefield. This fed to aspirited discussion in which the Dr., Rev B.H.Davis, Mr. Alger, myself, and some others took part.It seemed pretty conclusive to most of us thatMr. Wakefield deserved the denunciation utteredagainst him, and that his conduct, whatever mightbe his intentions, was utterly inconsistent with hisprofessions either as an Abolitionist or a Christianteacher. We found faithful friends of the cause atFeltonville, and the word of our testimony waswell received. Quite a number subscribed for theLiberator. Our friends S.S. and A.K. Fosterwrought a good work in Marlboro' some weeksprevious to our visit. Several strong men, heretoforedevotedly attached to the pro-slavery partiesand sects, have come out for thorough going anti-slavery,and are giving their whole influence tothe cause. I intended to name some of those, andto mention several interesting fuels in connectionwith their conversion; but the limits of this communicationwill oblige me to forbear. Our kindbrethren at Feltonville entertained us moat hospitablywhile among them, and forwarded us onSaturday to Berlin, our next place of appointment. At Berlin we found another clerical Liberty Partyback fire. Rev. Mr. Adams, a professed Abolitionist,bad not publicly warned the people againstbearing us, yet the Baptist minister of Bolton, withwhom he exchanged the preceding Sunday, onbeing requested to read a notice of our Convention,replied that if it were his own case he thought heshould give the notice, but his instructions fromMr. Adams were to give no such notice, and totake no notice whatever of the meeting. This proceedingwent abroad and probably advertised ourConvention more effectually than could have beendone by a simple reading of the notice from thepulpit. Any how, we had a large and spirited,gathering. The Town House was crowded to discomforton Sunday. The friends had preparedents in s neighboring grove which would havebeen occupied had not the weather been wet. Themeetings were addressed on Sunday by S.S. andA.K. Foster, Dr. Hudson, myself and several otherfriends. Quite a delegation came up from Feltonville,and promo nent brethren from the neighboringtowns were in attendance. It was a refreshingand profitable season. Our friends at Berlin,is has been the case every where else, made usperfectly at home and afforded us every needfulcomfort.  [TO BE CONTINUED.]
