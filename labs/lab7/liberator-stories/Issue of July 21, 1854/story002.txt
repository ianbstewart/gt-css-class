 These are few questions on which Southern menhave differed more widely than that which involvesthe proper made, both socially and politically, of abolitionists. Mr. Clay was of opinionthat it was best to receive their petitions, considerthem  and refute their positions by reasonand argument. Other Southern men have doubtlessa total aversion to showing this much respecteither to the petitioners or to their prayers. Thelate extraordinary avowal of Mr. Summer in theSenate in regard to his view of the obligations underthe Constitution, has revived the question. Inthe special case stated by Mr. Clay of Alabama,in his  withering denunciation of Mr. Summer, itseems to us to be difficult to see how any doubt couldexist as to the answer that ought to be given.. Atthe same time we are bound to say that we dodoubt the policy of giving such notoriety to Mr.Summer as was given to him in the late debatein the Senate. But without discussing this questionwe invite attention to the remarks of Mr.Clay of Alabama:    Excuse me one moment. I am not in the habitof  often on the Senate. Mr. President.I could go on and show that there is intrinsic evidencein this report to sustain the original reportof the reporter: and what is it? Why, sir, that, this qualified denial, the Senatorfrom South Cardina treated it as a positive denialof the Senator from Massachusetts, that he wouldsupport the Constitution of the United States. does any intelligent man believe, thatif the Senator had qualified that denial in the mannerwhich it appears now, that the Senator from Carolina would still have maintained that to obey oath—that he had refusedto sustain the Constitution? Does any one believethat the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Mason] wouldhave repeated the charge? Does any one believethat the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Pettit] wouldalso have repeated it? Certainly not. Then there evidence in the report itself, that these have been interpolated—that they were not Excuse    manner      Now Mr. President, I have a few more words tosay which I  with great diffidence, and withthe profoundest deference to older Senators on thisfloor.  have no means of preventing these violatiousof the dignity and proprieties of the SenateThere is no  statute which can reach amen who only  his willingness to commitcrime But let me ask, suppose a private citizen,however wealthy and well-born, however highly his mind, however great his talents,or  his  quirements, should openly avow his to commit moral perjury; should day byday  a disposition to instigate other men to which from want of personal courage, he himself; should daily encourageother men to violate the rights of hisneighbors to  their property to kidnap theirslaves and to refuse to return them; should daily the feelings of his neighbors by wanton,rude and uncalled for assaults upon their charactersand when rebuked for it in the harshest mostoffensive and opprobrious language like the should quietly submit to beg for quarter, butnever repair the wrong, or resent the insult—aspeaking sinuous, snake like poltroon, who would all the rights of associates or friends, andnever make reparation or acknowledge his error,and who held himself irresponsible to all law,feeling the obligation neither of the divine law, norof the law of land, nor of the law of honor: Iask you how would such a miscreant he treated! if you could not reach him with the arm ofthe municipal law, if you could not send him tothe penitentiary you would send him to Coventry.You would exclude him from the pale of society;you would neither extend to him the courtesies that gentlemen, nor permit him to offer suchto you. You would make him feel that he was like a leper, and loathed like a filthy and you would soon render him as impotent evil as he was disinclined for good.   Senate   let        neighbors      send him to Coventry.     Such characters, though rare may be found,and have been known. I can give, from memory,the general outlines of one portrayed by Mr. in his novel, 'David Copperfield'—that ofUriah Heap. Uriah was mean, yet affected honor;was malignant vet feigned benevolence: yet affected humility: instigated others toviolence be dared not commit, yet assumed an airof  suggested crimes and incited others their commission, yet bore himself with studiedamenity of manners, and choice expressions of benignityWe have such a character on this floor.I have suggested our means of rebuking, if wecannot silence him; of disabling, if we cannot If we cannot check individual abuseswe may preserve the dignity of this body. If wecannot the feelings ans rights of Southern gentlemenwe may rob the  of his fangs. Wecan  his influence by placing him in that of social degradation which he merits. I amsurprised—I repeat— I am surprised that honorablemen but especially Southern men, should sofor forget their rights and those of their constituents,and their duties to them, as well as to themselves,as to lend any countenance to such a characteras I have portrayed.'
