 Our resident Consul at London, G.N. Sanders,a native of Kentucky, has resided much at theNorth, and caught some of the Northern feeling inbehalf of European freedom, and thereby obtainedthe confidence of Mazzini and Kossuth. He is aviolent partisan in all pro-slavery schemes in America.Sanders felt himself implicated by Mazzini'slate letter to the English Abolition Society. Inthe absence of Mazzini, he indited a letter to Kossuth,deprecating the disturbance of the slaveryquestion in the United States, and charging theevil all on England. Kossuth replies to him asfollows: 21 ALPHA ROAD, REGENT'S PARK, LONDON,Saturday, June 3, 1854. LPHA OAD EGENT ARK ONDON  DEAR SIR: Upon carefully reading your letter, Ireply, that while deploring the existence of Slaveryanywhere, all my principles are against foreign interferencewith the domestic affairs of another nation.Besides, though be it from natural necessity,be it from the impassivity of its leading statesmen,the United States do not yet appear conscious oftheir competent position: still, I consider thestrength and prosperity of the only republicanpower on earth so important to the future destiniesof the world, that I certainly never would contributeanything to its internal divisions. Nay, trueto my principles, I cannot recognize any divisionin America; I look to the brotherhood of the greatRepublic as a whole, and have too high a respectfor the American people as one undivided body ofsincere republicans, as not to believe they will ofthemselves, with all the light before them, maketheir nation a model for every other. EAR IR You are quite right in your belief that Mazzini'sletter has no reference to the present agitation inthe United States: this is made certain by the factof its being an old letter. With high regard and sincere esteem, yours respectfully, L. KOSSUTH.
