As wehave judged it bost, in the present temper of thepublic mind, to postpone indefinitely the holdingof the meeting to which the letter refers, we deemit advisable no longer to delay the appearance ofso eloquent and so faithful a testimony to that greatcause of freedom, which, as M. Massi inthe same in the d of the slaver ofAmerican as it is in the  States of Italy.It is the source of much gratifiection that M. Mazzinipossess so much clearer  of humanrights than does and Icannot but  its will take root in the heart of many a refuges fromthe despotisms of the old world, who has founda resting place on the other side of the Atlantic. EAR IR                 Truly yours, F.W. CHESSON. Manchester, 17th May, 1854.
