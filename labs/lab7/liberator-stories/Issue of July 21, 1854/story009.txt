 Read the noble letter of the Italian patriot, inanother column. How glorious do his character,position, and principles contrast with those of theinfamous John Mitchel! His philanthropy is world-wide. It is appropriate,that in England he should exhort the peoplenot 'to forget, whilst at work for the emancipationof the black race, the million of white slaves, suffering,struggling, expiring in Europe.' So, doubtless,oh this side of the ocean, he would exhort theprofessed friends of Italian and Hungarian freedomnot to forget the millions of black slaves attheir own doors. True philanthropy and a truelove of freedom are impartial. It is a bastardphilanthropy. which, in the United States, professesgreat seal for freedom in Europe, while aidingto crush the Southern slave; or which, in England,makes great ado over the miseries of theblacks of this country, and ignores the oppressionof millions at their own doors. True devotion tofreedom and justice embraces the world in its effortsand sympathies.
