 The Fourth is past, and the Union is safe. Thenoisy people who have been counting their patriotismin dollars and cents, and clamoring about thenecessity of immediate dissolution, were either as stones on the Fourth, or street sharers inthe festivities of the day. No where was heard asingle protest against the nation's rejoicings.From Maine to New Orleans, the memory of ourDeclaration of Independence was honored, andfresh promises of loyalty to the constitution implied.Even in Rhode Island common sence ,and the glorious anniversary was celebratedin accustomed style. Where wore the demagogueswho said that, after the Nebraska bill, no Northernman could rejoice in the idea of the Union!Where were those who assured  that the constitutionwas henceforth a vain word, and that everythingtending to bring to mind the compact underwhich we live would inspire  silence, intendof shouts of joy? Where were the disunionista,the fanatics, the Parkers and the Greeleys, in whoes the Union has long stank, and who are forever warning us that it exists only by sufferance,and requires but a single blow to destroy it?      If any of the brood were visible that day, wehave not heard of it. If any one  disunion,he whispered it in a very quite way in asecluded place where no one would have heardhim, had he shouted it at the top of his lunga. Sofar as the public are aware, the people were to aman faithful to the Constitution. The day wasperhaps never celebrated with more enthusiasm anduniversal good feeling. Every city and village hadits fireworks and its oration. The fashionables, ofcourse, whose nerves cannot bear the noise of ,were  among the rural ; butthe thew and sinew of the people were in town, andright heartily did they speak their mind in .Rockets, and crackers, and pistol , and in the  may seem small ; butsmall as they are, they are not by the people on national celebrations whenthere is say general  of the government  to the . A  to , in fact, the shadow which  before them. evil was broading when the  would go no more fetez; and when the populace of New Yorkdecline to celebrate the Fourth with fireworks, andnoise, and every demonstration of popular ,then we may look anxiously forward to the future.Bat so long as such acenes as Tuesday mark the recurrenceof our National Anniversary, we maysafely leave the State to the guidance of fortune,and smile at the impotent violence of the actions.                       fetez   It has already become a desperate struggle tokeep the anti-Nebraska sentiment alive. It requireda tremendous organization of illegal violence atBost on to prevent its demise some weeks back:and more recently, a Senator of the United Stateshas been employed to galvanize fresh vigor into themoribund, at the  of his own character forhonor and truth. But even these desperate remediesdo not seem to be attaining any satisfactoryend. Nebraska and its organization are fast dyingout of men's memories. We have too much to doin the present day to fight or weep over bygones.If anything could have given a semblance of vitalityto the party led by Mr. Seward and his organs,it would have been some demonstration on the 4th.The event we commemorate on that day is the rootand origin of the grievances of the abolitionists.The sane members of that body cannot pretend thattheir views are consistent with the Constitution;they must admit—as many of them have done—that they are radically opposed to that compact itself,and that their aim, in one word, is to undo thework which was begun on the 4th of July, 1776.For these men, therefore, to join in celebrating theanniversary of that day is the rankest inconsistency.They should spurn the thought of such athing. For them, the 4th of July ought to be a dayof weeping and sorrow. All the miseries they bewailtook their origin in the concerted action of thethirteen colonies: and if they seek to achieve anythingat all, they must begin by convincing thepublic that the action of those colonies was an errorto be deplored and corrected, not an exploit tobe exalted and magnified. It is impossible for anyconscientious disunionist to wake on the morningof the 4th of July, without intense feelings of regretand anger.
