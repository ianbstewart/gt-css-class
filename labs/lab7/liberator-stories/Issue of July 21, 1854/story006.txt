 Mr. Editor:â€”We read with great regret in yourpaper, the correspondence between George N.Sanders and Kossuth, about Slavery, for we canby no means share your favorable opinion on themeaning of Kossuth's letter. The ex-Consul hashit his aim substantially, by eliciting from the manwho pretends to represent in his person the EuropeanDemocracy, the declaration, that he takesno practical interest in the burning question whichdivides at present the American people into twohostile camps. Kossuth has proved by that position,to be a diplomat and a politician, BUT NOT THEMAN FOR RESCUING THE EUROPEAN NATIONS FROM THEGRASP OF DESPOTISM, and delivering them to the awayof humanity. Since Kossuth, when he left America,HAS REQURATMED to the adopted citizens of Germandescent in this country, the duty to preservethe CONSCIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM IN THIS NATION, andas the battle now to be fought in America fro liberty'ssake, is, in the opinion of the German republicans,BY NO MRANS INFERIOR TO THAT AT HAND ATTHIS MOMENT IN EUROPE, we consider it our dutyto denounce said letter of Kossuth, with its frostyand only theoretical denial of American slavery,as a MRAN AND COWARDLY ACT, becoming only theVERY KOSSUTH WHO VOTED to the Austrian army, inItaly, Oct. 1849, at the very eve of the decision ofthe fats of the Italian nation, 42,000 auxiliariesof his countryman. Mr. Editor diplomat UROPEAN  UROPE OSSUTH Kossuth is of course, from this moment, in ouropinion, NOTMING BUT A MITCHEL, without even theFRANKNESS OF THE RASCALITY OF A MITCHEL. ITCHEL ITCHEL. THE GERMAN RADICALS. HE ERMAN ADICALS.
