 DEAR SIR—I have delayed to the present momentmy answering your kind invitation, in thehope that I should, perhaps, be enabled to give abetter answer than a written one; but I find thatneither health nor business will allow me to attend.I must writs, and express to you, and through youto your friends, how much I feel grateful for yourhaving asked me to attend the first meeting of the'North of England Anti-Slavery Association;' howearnestly I sympathies with the noble aim you aregoing to pursue: how deeply I shall communewith your efforts, and help, if I can their success.No man ought ever to inscribe on his flag the sacredword of 'Liberty,' who is not prepared toshake hands cordially with those, whoever theyare, who will attach their names to the constitutionof your association. Liberty man be the godlikegift of all races, of all nations, of every being whobears on his brow the stamp of MAN, or sink to thelevel f a narrow and mean self-interest, unworthyof the tears of the good and the blood of the brave.I am yours, because I believe in the unity of God;yours, because I believe in the unity of mankind;yours, because I believe in the educatibility of thewhole human race, and in a heavenly law of indefiniteprogression for all; yours, because the fulfillmentof this law implies the consciousness and theresponsibility of the agent, and neither consciousnessnor responsibility can exist in slavery; yours,because I have devoted my life to the emancipationof my own country. And I would feel unequal tothis task, a mean rebel, not an apostle of truth andjustice, had I not felt from my earliest years thatthe right and duty of revolting against lies andtyranny were grounded on a far higher sphere thanthat of the welfare of one single nation: that theymust start from belief in a principle, which willhave sooner or later to be universally applied:—'One God, one humanity,  law, one love from allfor all.' Blessed be your efforts, if they start fromthis high ground of a common faith; if you do notforget, whilst at work for the emancipation of theblack race, the millions of white slaves, suffering,struggling, expiring, in Italy, in Poland, in Hungary,throughout all Europe; if you always rememberthat free men only can achieve the work offreedom, and that Europe a appeal for the abolitionof slavery in other lands will not wright all-powerfulbefore God and men, whilet Europe herself shallbe desecrated by arbitrary, tyrannical power, bycasars, emperors, and popes. EAR IR 'One God, one humanity,  law, one love from allfor all.  Ever faithfully yours, JOSEPH MAZZINI. Rev. Dr. Beard, Manchester.
