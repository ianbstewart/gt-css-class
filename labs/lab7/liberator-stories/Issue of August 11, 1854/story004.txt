 The following extract will show the abolitionravings of some infuriated preachers at theNorth are viewed in the latitude of Richmond.We fully concur with the Whig in regarding suchpreaching as a desecration of the Sabhath, the pulpit,and of the injustice to the Northern clergy as abody, when it groups them in such wretched company.This Higginson, if we mistake not, hasbeen indicted as one of the rioters whose operationresulted in the murder of constable Batchelderat Boston. From all that we have heard abouthim. we judge that he is another Theodore Parker,bating the talents and perhaps also the infidelityof the latter. He is not to be taken as a fair specimenof the New England Orthodox clergy. thougha good many of them are more or less tincturedwith the same weakness and folly. on the otherhand, there are great numbers of them who disapproveand lament such pulpit demoralization, andare not partakers of the sin, either in sympathy oract.—N.Y.

It is no uncommon occurrence, of late days, forthe puritans of New England to desecrate the Sabbathin listening to the rantings of infuriated abolitioniste,on that day, done up in the form ofsermons. The descendants of our strait-lace puritanicalforefathers now substitute a morbid politicalcreed for the Bible, from which they drawtheir text, the political hustings for the pulpit,and a set of outcast political hacks, clothed in thelivery garb of Heaven, the better to enable them toserve the devil in, for Orthodox ministers of thegospel. We have recently had an illustration ofthis by the reception of an incendiary with the following imposing title-page: chusetts in Mourning: A Sermon preached inWorcester on Sunday, June 4th,1854. By ThomasWentworth Higginson, Minister of Free Church.' The Reverend divine proceeds todeliver himself of a load of hypocritical cant inthe following manner:— sermons.    'You have imagined my subject  forthere is but one  on which I could preach. or youcould listen, to-day. Yet, how hard it is to say oneword of that! You do not ask, at a funeral, that thebereaved  them slaves should speak, but youcall in one a little further , to  words ofcomfort, if comfort there be. But to-day is, or shouldbe, to every congregation in  a day offuneral service—we are all  and what isthere for me to say?'        The above is the introductory paragraph to the Sabbath-day sermon that follows. It isa  of sypoorisy,  and throughout. We make but one more extract toshow the character of this nefarious now sent to the South for circulation. It is follows:—       'Do not despair of the Republic.' says  rememberingthe hopeful old Roman . But theyhad to despair of that one in th —and why this one ? why, when we are going , step bystep, as older republics have done, should we expect tostop just as we reach the brink of Ningara? the loveof liberty grows stronger every year,  think insome places. Thirty years ago it cost  twenty-fivedeliars to it costs $100,000——but still theknow there are thousands of bearts which to liberty now, and these may save the spite of her official and her millitey; but the station? They may give us , but can they give us anything better? Canthey even give us anything ?'          but still the       The missalled Rev, Thomas Westworth son, in discoursing to his New England consules them with the idea that  give them disunion instead of they can give them nothing better, and tors to their country; and it would be that theybe furnished with rape enough to hang them, onBoston Common, until they meet a traitor's doom.           For the credit of the New England State, wewould fain hope that such Sabbath-day desecrations,and treasonable emanations, do not meet withthe sanction of all classes of society there, but fromthe frequency of their occurrence, we are constrainedto believe that there is something rotten in thesascendency throughout that whole section.
