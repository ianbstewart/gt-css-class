 TO THE EDITOR OF THE LONDON DAILY NEWS: O DITOR ONDON AILY EWS SIR— I have just read, with great surprise, your paper of yesterday's date, a correspondingbetween Mr. G.N. re the American M. Kossuth relation to M. American slavery, which I publication some time ago. IR      Mr. Sandere states that 'the  is withoutdate; and, as  is not now in London to owerfor himself, we are left to guess at the time itwas written. It speaks against slavery in general;but not a word  in it about Americanaffairs in any way. * * * I regret, therefore,to see the latter so introduced by the gentlemangiving it publicity as to lead to the impression thatit was intended by Massini to  upon the slavecontroversy now convulsing the United States.'M. Kossuth, in reply, after expressing his viewsagainst foreign interferes with American slavery,concludes by saying. 'You are quite right inyour belief that Massins's letter has no referenceto the present agitation in the United States.'      I does it to be my duty to reply to these statements,inasmuch a they put both Massini, theAbolition Society, and myself, in a wrong position.I will take up each point seriatim. 1. InMarch last, the Committee of the Anti-SlaveryLeague contemplated holding a public meeting inManchester, and through their Chairman, Dr.Beard, invited Massini to be present, with theknowledge that he had expressed sympathy withthe most radical section of the American anti-slaveryparty, and warm admiration for William LloydGarrison. The reply of Massini, which now liesbefore me, is dated London, March 25th. I shouldhave sent copies of it to the newspaper at the time,but being desirous that it should be read at ourcontemplated meeting. I kept it back for twomonths, with the hope that the excitement of thepublic mind on the war question would so far abateas to render it prudent for us to hold the meeting.We were, however, obliged to abandon the project;whereupon I at once forwarded you a copy of theletter. 2. Massini's letter is something more than a denunciationof slavery 'in general.' He expresseshis 'gratitude' at being invited to attend our meeting;his 'earnest sympathy' with our 'noble aim;'hi determination to help us, if 'he can'; and declaresthat 'no man ought ever to inscribe on hisflag the sacred word 'Liberty,' who is not preparedto shake hands cordially with those, whenever theyare, who will attach their names to the Constitutionsof the Association.' The Constitution, in itsfourth article, states that the following are amongthe agencies to be employed by the Society:— 'To circulate current intelligence  Britain, inregard to the evils of slavery and the slave trade; toinform the public mind as to the objects and principlesof the abolitionists, especially these of the UnitedStates; to correspond with the friends of the cause invarious countries; and to sympathies with and them in their  a far as us consistentwith the principle of this Society.    To demand that the colored subjects of the Britishcrown, who visit the slave States of American shall havethe same measure of freedom as is accorded to Americancitizens who visit the country; and to carry thisprinciple into fall and complete effect. To employ every suitable effort to enlighten the consciencesof the slaveholders and their supporters, as tothe moral turpitude and unchristian character of thesystem which they uphold and to endeavor to elicit thetestimony of the religious denominations of this countryagainst the conduct of the  bodies ofthe United States which countenance slavery.'  Moreover. the address which proceeds the Constitution(a copy of which I enclose) recognizes'the American Anti-Slavery Society, of which Mr.Wm. Lloyd Garrison is President, not as the onlyanti-slavery party in the United States, but as thegreat vital organization in which the hopes of theabolitionists must for the most part centre,' so thathowever Mr. Sandere and M. Kossuth may latthe facts, at which I rejoice, they must hereafterbelieve that Massini, unlike some of hi associates,sympathizes actively not only with the oppressed inItaly and Hungary, and throughout Europe, butwith the down-trodden victims of republican oppression,who are as much entitled to his pity andhis help as the suffering in his own land.  The 'policy' of Kossuth may be advanced, but iti a grave question whether his fair fame will be improvedby his asking for our interference in the affairsof Hungary, while, at the same time, for thepurpose of gainting the support of the pro-slaveryparty, he is strously advocating 'non-interfence,'on our part with that 'peculiar institution'which John Wesley justly stigmatined as being'the sum of all villainies.' Mr. Sandere makes some very extraordinary statementsrelative to American slavery. He has greatfaith (and wishes the  of Europe to havean equal measure of it) in 'the honor, and justice,and generosity of the Southern States'; and thinksthat the question of slavery may be safely left tothem. Does Koussuth not upon the principle of the cause of freedom in Hungary to FrancisJoseph, and in Naples to the Southern tyrants?But if the slaveholders have 'honor, and justice, and'; if they really desire the abolition ofslavery, how comes it that, step by step, since the they have added thefollowing slave States to the Union— Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas, and that in flagrantviciationof the Missouri compromise, and of the of the great majority of the people of theNorth, they have just added the  Territoryof Nebraska to their dark domains? If theyprine 'honor and ,' why do they break  and openly advocate renbbery and for the  would both— with no other object than to increasethe Slave Power!                Yours, very respectfully,FRED.W. CHESSON,  Anti-Slavery League.  Anti-Slavery League.  Manchester, .  ☞ Mr.  in a  latter to the (N.Y.) —     The  and Sandere correspondence, towhich I  last week, has  letter in the              to the brotherhood of the whole people as an undividedbody of sincere Republicans, but he will notmake one man on earth forget that there is a wholerace within the bounds of that Republic, who held in no brotherhood at all; and that some ofthese 'sincere Republicans,' while advocating therights of free thought over brute obedience in Europe,are enforcing that 'brute obedience' at all risksin America. No; this infidelity to principle andtruth is not the way to advance the cause of libertyanywhere, or under any circumstances. To perceiveand tell the truth, and to sympathies withthe genuine Republicans, instead of insulting byignoring them, is the only way to serve the goodcause, either in Europe or America.'          There is some good talk for you. I wonder howthat precious Republican, Mr. Sanders, liked it.He is quite silent. F.W. CIIESSON.
