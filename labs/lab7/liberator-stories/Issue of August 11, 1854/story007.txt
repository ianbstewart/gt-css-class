 Extracts from 'A Sermon of the Dangers whichthreaten the Rights of Man in America; preached atthe Music Hall, on Sunday, July 2, 1854, by THRODOREPARKER':— HRODORE ARKER See the steady triumph of despection! Tenyears more like the ten years past, and it will beall over with the liberties of America. Everythingmust go down, and the beel of the tyrant will beon our neck. It will be all over with the Rightsof Man in America, and you and I must go to Austria,to Italy, or to Siberia, for our freedom; orperish with the liberty which our fathers foughtfor and secured to themselves, not to their faithlessons. Shall America thus miserably perish!Such is the aspect of thing to-day! But are the people alarmed! No, they fear nothing,only the tightones in the money market! Next Tuesday,at sunrise, every bell in Boston will ring joyously;every cannon will belch sulfurous Welcomefrom it brass throat. There will be processions,— the Mayor and the Alderman, and theMarshal and the Naval Officer, and, I suppose, the'Marshel's Guard,' very appropriately takingtheir places. There is a chain on the to-day; it is the same chian that was  theCourt House in 1851; it is the chain that boundSimns; now it is a festal chain. Beware the chain!it is the Father of Lies! There are motine aboutthe Common— 'They actually pledged to eachother their lives, their fortuned and their honor.' I suppose it means that the mayor andthe kidnappers did this. 'The spirit of 76 stilllives.' Lives, I suppose, in the Supreme Court ofFugitive Slave Bill judges. 'Washington, Jeffersonand their  their  are in the hears of every American. That, Isuppose, is the opinion of Thomas Sims and AnthonyRurns. And oppoins the great Park Church,— where a noble man is this day, I trust,discoursing noble words, for he has never yet beenfound false to freedom,— ' Liberty and Independenceour  wetheir case should ought to read, 'God  that we their have proved on  to the  willchildren as Slares.

Shelf America thus perish, all immature?                         He was in drank, they pleased, they they were given in marriage, until the day thatNoah entered into the Ark, and the Flood cameand devoured them all!   Well, Is this to he the end? Was it for this thePilgrimage came over the sea? Does Forefathers'Rock assent to it? Was it for this that the NowEngland elergy prayed, and their prayers becamethe law of the land for a hundred years? Was itfor this that Cotton planted in Boston a littlebranch of the Lord's vine, and Roger Willaimsand Higginson—he still lives in an unregenerateson—did the same in the city which they called ofPeace, Salem? Was it for this that Eliot carriedthe Gospel to the Indiane? that Chauncey andEdwards and Hopkins and Mayhew and Channingand Ware labored and prayed? for this that ourfathers fought—the Adameces, Washington, Hancock?for this that there was an eight years' warand a thousand battle Solds? for this the littlemonuments at Aston, Concord, Lexington, WestCambridge, Danvers, and the great one over thereon the spot which our fathers blood made so red?Shall America become Asia Minor? Now England,Italy? Boston such as Athens—dead and rotten?Yes! if we do not mend, and speedilymend. Ten years more, and the Liberty of Americais all gone. We shall fall—the laugh. the by-word,the proverb, the scorn, the mock of the nations,who shall cry against us. Hell from beneathshall be moved to meet us at our coming, and inderision shall it welcome us; "The heir of all the ages, and the youngest born oftime." We shall lie down with the unrepentant prodigalsof old time, damned to everlasting infamy andshame. Would you have it so? Shall it be? To-day, America in a debauched young man, ofgood blood, fortune, and family, but the companionof gamesters and brawlers; reeking with wine;wasting his substance in riotous living; in the lapof harlots squandering the life which his mothergave him. Shall he return? Shall be perish? Oneday may determine. Shall America thus die? I look to the past,—Asia, Africa, Europe,—and they answer, 'Yes!'Where is the Hebrew Commonwealth; the RomanRepublic; where is liberal Greece.—Athens andmany a far-famed Ionian town; where are theCommonwealths of Medieval Italy; the Teutonicfree cities—German, Dutch, or Swias? They haveall perished. Not one of them is left. ParianStatues of Liberty, sorely mutilated, still remaln;but the Parian rock whence Liberty once hewedher sculptures out—it is all gone. Shall Americathus perish! Greece and Italy both answer,'Yes!' I question the last fifty years of Americanhistory, and it says, 'Yes!' I look to the Americanpulpit, I ask the five million Sunday Schoolscholars, and they say, 'Yes!' I ask the FederalCourt, the Democratic Party, and the Whig, andthe answer is still the same. But I close mu eyes on the eleven past misstepswe have taken for Slavery: on that seven-foldclandestine corruption. I forget the Whig party;I forget the present Administration: I forget theJudges of the Courts: I remember the few noblestmen that there are in society. Church and State;I remember the grave of my father, the lessons ofmy mother's life: I look to the Spirit of this Age,—it is the nineteenth century, not the ninth: Ilook to the history of the Anglo-Saxons in America,and the history of Mankind: I remember thestory and the song of Italian and German Patriots:I recall the dear words of those great-mindedGreeks—Ionian, Dorian, Ætolian; I rememberthe Romans who spoke and song and foughtfor truth and right; I recollect those old HebrewProphets, earth's nobler sons, Pests and Saints;I recall to mind the greatest, noblest, purest soulthat ever blossomed in this dusty world :—and Isay, 'No!' Truth shall triumph, Justice shall belaw! And if America fail, though she is one-fortiethof God's family, and it is a great loss,there are other nations behind as; our Truth shallnot perish, even if we go down. But we shall notfail! I look into your eyes, young man and women,thousands of you, and men and women far enoughfrom young! I look into the eyes of fifty thousandother men and women, whom, in the last eightmonths, I have spoken to, face to face, and theysay, 'No ! America shall not fail!' I remember the women who were never foundfaithless when a  was to be offered to greatprinciples; I look up to my God, and I look intomy own heart, and I say, We shall not fail! Weshall not fail!  This, at my side, it is the willow! it is thesymbol wesplng :—but Its leaves are deciduous;the  wind will strew them on the ground;and  here is a personal plant—It is greenall the year through. When this willow branchis  the other is green with hope, and itsbuds are in its bosom; its buds will blossom. Soit is with America.    Did our fathers live? Are we d? Even inour ashes live their holy  only slecps;one day she will  will stiragain! New  will  and walk? thevanished North be found same  andmajestic! Then it will be same that Slavery isweak and powerless in Itself, only a  ofthe night.        Slavery is a 'Finally,' is it ! There shall he no'Agitates not the it.
