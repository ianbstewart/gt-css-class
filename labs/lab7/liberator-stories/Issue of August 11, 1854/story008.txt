 The Anti-Slavery  of this country has alwaysbeen  in the United States with the argumentsthat every  most  its own internalaffairs without the  of anyother power; and when this  is  its in the institution which it United States to  within  Inthe Southern States they may  and them in the market, as we broad and and although every man and woman in the world,in their individual capacity, may  againstthe hideous wrong committed against humanity,yet our Government ought not to inorfore Butthe citizens of the United States of America havelong since  the limits which would proventthis nation in its national capacity taking activesteps in relation to the slavery question. Directaggressions have been made upon Britishliberties, and are continually being made, and yetno active steps are being taken by the authoritiesin Downing street to defend her Majesty's subjectsfrom wrong and injury of the darkest dye.                   Some of our readers are perhaps not aware ofthe fact, that if a British ship arrives at Charleston,the chief port of South Carolina, every coloredman on board is directly arrested by the policeauthorities of the town, and imprisoned duringthe time that the vessel remaine in port, simplybecause the Almighty has seen  to createhim with a dark skin. The jail  are heavy inCharleston, and the charges for maintenance inprison are placed exorbitantly high; so that it is aprofitable thing for the gaoler to keep the negroesor mulattoes in durance. When the vessel is aboutto sail, the prisoner is required to pay all the captainis called upon for them, and if he cannot givethe money or is unwilling to give, the innocentman is sold into slavery to pay these iniquitouscharges. Every year subjects of Queen Victoriaare thus sent into bondage, for no crime againsteither human or Divine law. The matter has fromtime to time been brought under the notice of HerMajesty's Government, who have always promisedto give the matter their most serious attention.The matter has been brought before both Housesof Parliament, and the Government have in everycase been successful in postponing the of dispatches or a full discussion of the question.During the present session, Mr. Kinnaird,the member for Perth, introduced the subject, andLord John Russell stated that hopes were entertainedthat the State of South Carolina wouldameliorate its laws, and thus prevent the necessityof any further steps being taken. Mr. Kiunairdallowed himself to be satisfied with these hopes,and the subject was dropped.   sold into slavery  We cannot imagine upon what ground LordJohn Russell could give utterance to any expectationssuch as those here quoted. At the very timehe did so, the slavery party in the States wereurging on a measure which throws open the wholeterritory of Nebraska and Kanas—to the accruedrule of slavery, notwithstanding the fact thatthis very country had been guaranteed to freedomby the most solemn pledges of the United StatesGovernment: and now this measure is carried,and the villany is accomplished, and slavery isstronger than ever it was before. Since LordJohn Russell made his statements, a fugitive hasbeen taken from the streets of Boston by theUnited States Government and sent back into bondage.The same day on which this occurred, fourfugitives were given up in New York to the kidnappers,who claimed them as their property. InBoston the people were fearfully excited, but theslave power was too great: and a friend of ours,who left Boston a week after the rict,  us thatnow the people say, It was folly to make such a for a nigger!' In New York no excitementwas caused at all. But  all thisour Government hopes!—and when Lord was sent to Washington to nagotiste a treaty bywhich the question of the  was to besettled, and peace guaranteed by mutual it does not appear that this question of theinjustice systematically committed at Charlestonwas alluded to. We do not wish to  thevalue of an agreement upon a subject, which, notlong ago,  with but we do most  thisignoring of a great question of  rights.And what in the result of our  ofthis wrong? We read in the New York that when the treaty  by  into be laid before the  some intend to  that, before it is  aclaues shall be  by which the British Governmentpledges itself to give up the fugitivesfrom slavery now living in Canada, and also toextend the previsions of the American FugitiveSlave Law to our  in  AmericaThe United States  has carried the FugitiveSlave Law has passed the Nebraska Bill has beensuccessfulness in every attempt which it has made toextend the slave power: why should it not                New York               From our  of American papers, received bythe  we find that  of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in  in the Senate has lately moved to give noticeof the  of the with Great  the United States to a  for the of the  This,  ofthe law      of the Committee on Foreign Affairs                  Government that the  to  the .
