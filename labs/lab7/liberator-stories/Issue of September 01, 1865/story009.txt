 A Washington correspondent of the Portland Advertisersays he has heretofore indulged the belief that"Present Johnson would ultimately shake off thetrammels of the Republican party" and ally himselfwith the Democracy; but it grieves him "to be compelledto say that the indications are that there is noprospect that this will be done soon." The followingwhich this disheartened correspondent relates, seemsto be the cause of his diminished hopes of seeing thePresident restored to the Democratic fold:â€” Advertiser "A conversation has been detailed to me, whichtook place recently at the White House betweenPresident Johnson and a gentleman from one of theWestern States, prominent in the Republican party,which, I have reason to believe, expresses the determinationat which the President has arrived, inhis treatment of the Southern people. At this interviewthe President said, in substance, that hewas satisfied of the impolicy of making any fartherreduction in the army; that be doubted the genuinenessof the loyalty professed by a majority of thepeople of the South; that treason and rebellionthere, though crushed and repressed, still existed;that he would be glad to restore to the people of theSouth all their political rights, but that he wouldnot do it until he was certain that they would notabuse the privilege, by election to office of rebelsand traitors; that the recent elections in Virginiamade it quite clear that the people of that Stateare not heartily loyal, but would, if the opportunitywere offered to them, elect rebels and traitors tooffice in preference to Union men; that as soon ashe is convinced of the unquestioned loyalty of anyState, ho will withdraw the troops therefrom, andallow it the utmost freedom of election, etc.; butuntil he is so convinced, he intends to keep the presentmilitary force in each Southern State, and touse the military power in order to present the electionof rebels and traitors. He said, furthermore, that the contingency mightarise, nor was it improbable, when be should feel itto be his duty to remove the present provisionalgovernors, and place the government of those Statesentirely under the control of the military officers incommand of military department there; and intimatedthat it was with that view that the militarydepartments had been created. But he said that itdepended entirely on the people of the South themselveswhether he would do that or not; but thatthey must be made to realize that no person whohas been prominently connected with the rebellioncan be elected to office. If they can only learnthrough the presence of the military, why theymust learn it in that way. Such is the substance ofthis remarkable conversation on the part of thePresident."
