 On the 30 th ult., the second political battle betweenslavery and abolitionism was fought, andabolitionism driven to the bush. The victory ofthe pro-slavery party was complete, and it is to behoped that the question is now settled forever inthat territory. The fanatical propagandists ofthe North have only received a lesson in the Southernpolitical alphabet; and it may be well forthem if they do not push their inquiries any farther.Yankee inquisitiveness is proverbial, but weopine he has enough Southern and Western learningto do him for a time. The abolition vote inthe Territory was extremely meagre, and we donot suppose they will have a single member ineither branch of the legislature. What comesnow of the Northern boast that they were going toabolitionize Kansas, and make it a free State;They may yet do it, but their prospect is a littlegloomy at present.â€”Independence, Mo., Messenger.
