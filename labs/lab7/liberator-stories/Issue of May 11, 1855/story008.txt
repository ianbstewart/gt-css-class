Very well, we have concluded to giveany number of persons who wish to perpetrate suchan act of folly a free pass to 'kingdom come,' andwe pledge them every assistance in our power.probably many of them never took an upward journey,and would like to try the experiment of sailingon a blaze of glory, such as a couple of kegs of gunpowder,exploded at an opportune occusion, wouldfurnish. We have not a member of our family,ourself included, who would not deem a transit intothe future life with companions deu voyage of agoodly number of printing press destroyers as a favorrarely to be met with. Should the Herald ofFreedom office at any time be invaded for the purposeof destruction, we give this timely warning toall, both friend and foe, that unless they wish to'go up,' they had better keep aloof from its immediatevicinity, for our purposes are fixed, and theconsequences cannot be prevented.
