 The Minority of the Committee to whom was referredthe petition of undry colored citizens toabolish the distinction now existing with regardto colored children, and admit them intosuch schools as may be nearest their places ofresidence, having been unable to units with theMajority in the conclosions they have reached,and in the course they recommend, doem it necesearyto submit their views in a separate Report.  Whatever may have been the origin of our cmon School system, its present existence is renderedindispensable, by the nature our political institutions. The primary power in the State, thesource of all political authority, rests with us, in thewhole body of the people. Their will is the supremelaw, and they are fully competent to determinethe policy of the State, to after or change theirsystem to any extent, or in any manner they maydo right and proper.   Hence the necessity of general education, andhence the welfare of the whole fully barwith the highest interest of the individual. Thedoctrine the it is the duty of the State, flowingfrom these cireas, to educate its  members, and that it is the co-relative right of everychild in the State to receive its educat thecost, and order the direction of the community, isestablished , as  and under, asany principle or  can ever be Many other considerations, which go to show the and advantages of the Common School system, might be adverted to and enrged upon, if itwere through necessary, in connection with thesubject under consideration; but we rely uponthose before mentioned for general assent, and assufficient for the purpose in view and the presentoccasion.            Our Common Schools, then, are common to all;and each and all are legally entitled, without let orhindrance, to the equal benefit of all the advantagesthey may confer—es common to each and all,as the public highways, the courts of law, or thelight of day. It is the peculiar advantage of ourrepublican system, that it confers civil equality andlegal rights upon every citizen—that it knows noprivileged clase, and no degraded cl—that it confersno distinction, and creates no difference be-ween rich and poor, learned and ignorant, whiteand black; but places all upon the same level, andconsiders them alike entitled to its protection andits benefits.   The power of the School Committees we consider to be limited and constrained by this generalsplrit of our civil policy, and by the letter and spiritof the lows which regulate our Common Schoolsystem. They are to execute the duties devolvingupon them in strict accordance with the intent of thatsystem, and for the purposes only for which it is establishedand sustained. Any course on their partwhich does, or which tends to counteract, restrict orlimit, to any individual or class, the advantages andbenefits designed for all, must be considered as illegat arbitrary acts usually are, for percious purposes. These premises will receive, we presume,general assent; and we propose to apply them tothe question before us, and be governed by the conclusionsthey may reach.   This Board has decided that the children of coloredparents shallbe excluded from the schoolsgenerally, and shak be sent to separate or casteschools, into which no other than colored childrenshall be admitted. In this instance, therefore, theusual and necessary course, pursued with respectto other than colored children, of admitting theminto schools nearest their residence and most convenientfor them has, in the care of the coloredchildren, been departed from and overzed, for thepurpose of classing them together, obliging them togo by themselves, and excluding them from schoolintercourse with all others. For what purpose thisanomaly exists, we do not now inquire, but we willhereafter advert to it.  The authority of the School Committee to dothis is denied by the petitioners, and they repthe practice as a grievance that should be abolished.  The question which first arises is, have theSchool Committee any right or reason to establishsuch schools, and separate the children of the communityinto classes, to decide that the children ofthe colored people shall go by themselves exclusively, or that the children of lri parentage shallbe excluded from all others, and go by themselves,or the children of the poor in like manner? Shallany or all of these be selected, each from all, sortedour, and confined so separate schools?  If there is authority to do this in one instance, orto any one portion of the community who, in theexercise of our discretion or caprice, may be disignatedas a class, differing from others in some respector circumstances, it seems clear there is in allthe cases supposed. We apprehend, if this principle should be carriedout and applied to other classes or portions ofthe community, it would inevitably destroy ourpresent system of public instruction, and leave us todeplore the rum of the Common Schools, the bestand noblest legucy of our pgrim fathers.  On the point of legal authority to exclude coloredchildren from the common schools, and confinethem to separate schools, the Board have theopinion of Richard Fletcher, Esq., given at the requestof the School Committee of Salem, respectingthe legality of separate schools for colored childrenin that city. This opinion is full and explicit,and it wholly denies the right of the School Committeeof that city to make the distinction on theground of color, then in practice there, as now inthis. It is contended, however, that this opinion,which is admitted to be correct respecting the sepstateschools of Salem, where the city is divided intoterritorial districts, is of no authority when uppliedto Boston, which has no territorial boundariesto its school districts, that though, for all purposesexcept this of separate schools, we have eighteendistricts, with as many organized district committees, yet we have but one district in law, because wehave failed to establish territorial lies around ourdistricts, and therefore, taking advantage of thiscircstance, we avoid the obligations of the law,and are not violating its requirements. Thus, whatis law in Salem is not law in Boston, because theeighteen districts in Boston become oue district, andthe one distict becomes eighteen, to suit the convemienceof 'our peculiar institution' of coloredschools, but for no other purpose.   The aertion, that Mr. Fleteber's opinion is nottrue. The whole scope and force of line reasoning,from beginning to end, as well as the terms inwhich be states his conclusions, show that his opinionis entirely applicable to the case where districtsdo not exist. He nowhere alludes to their existencein Salem, although his attention is called tothem in the statement submitted to him, nor drawsa single inference therefrom. He could not saythat his conclusions are inapplicable to this city,without taking back every line and word which hehas uttered. No better summary of our views uponthis question can be made, than by adopting thefollowing language from his opinion.  'The principle of perfert equality is the vitalprinciple of the system (our free school system.)Here all classes of the community mingle together.The rich and the poor meet upon terms of equality.and are prepared to discharge the duties of life bythe came instructions. It is the principle of equality, chered in the free schools, on which our freegovernment and free institutions rest. Destroy thisprinciple in the schools, and the people wouldsoon ceses to be a tree people.  'I view of these principles, could the SchoolCommittee exclude any particular class of whitechildren from the free school, and provite for thema district and separate school? Could they, for instance, excludes the children of mechanics and laborers, and conf them to a separate school, districtfrom other classes? The School Commmittieshave the general charge and superintendence of the schools. But to  such a distinction as, would not surely come wish the ing of 'general charge and superintendence.' Itwould not be 'superin but  theof the             'The course of feet accordance with these general principles. 12 vol. Pick. 213 Perry as. Dover, it was decidedthat certain individuals cannot be selected and notby themselves  a district. The decisions ofthis last print bears directly upon the point underconsideration. It appears to  that there is nolaw, adjudication, or principle which would suborizea School Committee to exclude any class ofwhite children from the free schools, and them to district schools provided for them.       white  'But the question proposed to , can theSchool Committee of Salem exclude the coloredchildren from the free schools, and restrict th toa district school provided for them excly? Ican answer this question very briefly ying,that neither the constitution nor the laws of thisCommonwealth, make any distinction between a person and a white person. It may be saidthat the free school provided exclusively for coloredchildren is equally advantageous to them. I thinkit would be basy to show that this is not the case.But suppose it were so, it would in no way affectthe decision of the question. The colored childrenare lawfully entitled to the benefits of the freeschools, and are not bound to accept an equivalent.Except in the case of taking property for publicuse, no man can be compelled to relinquishwhat belougs to him for an equivalent. Every onemust leave his own, unless be consults to relinquishit.'      The whole argument may be stated thus. Thecolored man, as any other citizen, has the right tosend his child to the nearest school, subject only torestrictions for good and lawful reasons. But hisrace or his color is an unlawful and inhuman reasonfor restraining his right of choice; for our constitutionand laws have everywhere repdiated alldistinctions of citizens into classes, o this, or anyother ground, and have pronoced all possiblereasoning in support or justification of such distinctionsinsufficient and dangerous.    In this case, however, as in most others, wherearbitrary power is injuriously exercised, an attemptit made to justify the practice by the assumed ne-essities of the case, and to palliate it on the groundthat no injustice is done to, and no grievance is sustainedby, the complaining parties, but that it is betterfor all, but more especially is it for the good ofthe colored children, that they should be educatedby themselves, whereby, it is contended, they aremuch more rapidly advanced than they possiblycan be, by attending the schools with the whitechildren. This surprising fact is accounted for, ifwe understand aright, by the peculiarities of thecolored race. Interiority is by no means to be inferredfrom this arrangement, no sense of degradationis excited by it, but is precisely the one of allothers best adapted to promote their self-respect,advance their mental and moral development, andelevate their civilization!  surprising fact Whether these views are curront in the community, and are relied upon to exclude the coloredpeople from churches, lycenms, thestres, and allother places where the white race 'most do congergate,' We do not know, but it is to be feared thiscomfortable view of the matter has not yet reachedso far. It certainly was not held to be the reason.only a few years since for expelling them from thecabins to the fore-decks of sternposts, from thefirst clase to the Jim-Crow cars, and for nrious otherslike testin of brotherly regard on the part ofthe superior towards the inferior race. The mostsagacious, certainly, if not the most profound disemeryin political science, is due to our own time,and to our own country. This discovery, and theindefatigable geni which solved the problem ofan indefinite extension of the area of freedom bythe enlargement and prepetnity of slavery, mustboth, in our humble judgment, give place to thenew light in mental philosophy, which breaks forthfrom Jim-Crow schools, and the ingenuity whichproves them the most effective for elevatingthe colored race.   brotherly regard superior  them The assumption that these separate schools arenot unjust and grievous to the complainants, weconsider wholly unfounded. Is there no injusticeperpetrated? Is there no grievance inflicted by anarrangement that compels the colored residents ofSouth or East Boston to send their children toBelknap street, while the other children in the sameneighboroods are not, perhaps in a single instance,obliged to go more than a quarter of a mile? Tocompel the colored children of those parts of thecity, between the ages of four and seven years, to goto Belknap-street, or no where, is a practical denialof their right of tending school at all.   It may be said, and whether truly or not, we donot know, that there are no colored residence inSouth Boston or East Boston. But if such be thefact, the difficulty is not obviated, it is only changedto the other born of the dilemma—for if they wishto avail of public schooling, they are deprived of achoice of residence, and must move out of the cityas some have actually done for this purpose princepally, or they must, as most of them are obliged todo, locate themselves in the vicinity of the coloredschools, no matter what may be the character of theneighborhood, or how expensive, inconvenient o.disadvantageous, in other respects it may be. It is common enough to hear the assertion, 'theare a degraded race; they always have been soand they always will be so.' Without inquiriouwhether the wish may be father to the though,'may be admitted that as a class they may be somewhat degraded—that is to say, the degradatiowhich ignorance and severe poverty are apt to prodace, they are peculiarly liable to. In addition these, however, they labor under an influence paticular to them alone, and far more active to prodegradation than both ignorance and povertcontained. That repnance or prejudice, or bwhatever name we may designate it one the partthe white race, which prevents the colored peoplefrom entering into the general industrial pursuits othe community, and excludes them from the schoolslyc and colleges; this influence it is, whichpressing for ages upon an odious and ignorant nority, white or black, will undouldly produedegradation, and furni maple cause for the codition of the blacks among us.             Notwithstanding this, however, there are alwayindividuals of them, whom  man will, any just sense, consider as degraded—individualwho by the force of intellect, or other favorable custances, have gained for themselves, in the adverse circumstance of color, a characterwhich no man need be asof, but which amust respect.       Is there no self-stultification practiced by us?there no iniquitous hardship inflected upon him, say to such a man, we have only the standard color to class you by? We know nothing of itselect or morals, or resqutable standing, as applcable to you or to your children. No matter it live next door to an unexceptionable school, two miles from the poor school in the city,go to the poorest school$mdash;your children attend these schools, and be subjected to the uces which there prevail, had and evil though know them to be:—and although the probalinot to say certainty, will be, that you cannot, this necessity  lay upon you, hope to your children your  and irreproachable but must feel that they must be to the degraded level which the  of you,yet, cannot help it—we must form to our rules a high know nothing of you cept your color.

So long assuch a course is pur the colored people, we cannot doubt they  degraded to satisfy the  investerat of therace.                     When we d that it is as advantageous for thecolored children to attend the separate , asit would be to be educated with the white children,we do not mean to be underwood, that under othercircumstances than exist here, they might not receiveequal educational advantages from separateschools—but under the circumstances which doexist, we do deny, that they can receive equal benefitfrom separate, which they would from thecommon schools. They are a small minority, lessthan two  cent, of our city population. Theyhave  generally, and perhaps now are, by themajority, considered as a hopeless, inferior racewhile some even contend that they partake but the of the attributes of , and far more ofthose of the brute creation. Their character andcondition, it is said by such, is what it is, by the docr of Providene, irrespective of other influences.        The natural consequences of this here and ofsuch views, have operate upon the colored peoplewith a crushing severity. It has processed uponthem, upon their moral and incollectual character,their efforts and their condition, with a uniformityas all pervading and as effectual to keep the of the down, as the force of gravitation upon thehuman body is, to fix it to the earth.     It is, we believe, is obedience alone to this publicopinion, and on this ground only that these costsschools can be defended or excaused—the wholenecessity of the case, 'ha this extent,' and nomore than this.  With such influences operating upon theseschools, and to which they minister and tend greatly to perpenate, what can be expected from them?The inevitable effect of such influences upon theenergies and labors of the teachers, committeeand children, must necessarily follow, and thewant of heart and faith in the work, will enfeebleand paralyze the school and all connected with it.Where nothing is expected, but little will be attempted, and less accomplished.  Our reports will  them by with the usual remark, 'not much can be expected from this school,but it is believed to be in as good condition as atany former period, and as good perhaps as can beexpected from this chase of children.'  Out large professions, and our devotion to theprinciples of liberty and equality will not probablypermit us to abolish these schools, and turn thechildren adri, but otherwise, we can see nosufficient motive for continuing them. The averageattendance for six months of one, was 10 1-5.Its appearance is decidedly commtive, and weshould judge it would soon save us the necessity ofany formal action, by a natural death from that inveteratedis. The other, for the  period,average 34. But together, do not equal the averageattendance of one of the white schools. Thecost of schooling the colored childred is thereforemore than double that of the same number ofwhite children, and the result in education conferred, is in an inverse ratio to the expenditure.An exmation of these schools is a penance, towhich even the advocat of the system, ought notin common charity to be subjected, and we thinkthe forner committees of the school in Belkstreet, who, we were told by the teacher, had notexamined it but once for two years, should be heldfully excused, for what, those who judged withoutpersonal knowledge, might consider elpable neglect. devotion          If amy fears are entertained, that the abolition ofthese schools would be detrimental to the coloredchildren, we are constrained to say, we do not participatein them. We consider them a disgrace tothe city, whom vioin the beggarly amount ofeducation they confer, but a still greater on for theprejudice against color they countenance and lendtheir efficient aid to perpetuate.  We would not undervalue the small amount ofeducation they confer, for we do not admit theadage'a little learning is a dangerous thing,' butbelieve on the contrary, that even a little is a greatbeassing. But who of us would consent that his childrenshould take the little these schools confer, at theprice of infriority and  to associate withhe ?    This question is frequently considered as affectingonly the colored people, and if they, or eventhe majority of them, submit to the present arrangement, our duty in the premises is disobarged.We do not assent to this view of the matter. Awrong act or a wrong policy, is seldom confined inits is inflicted, but its influences are of much widerextent. We deem it morally injurious to thewhite children, inmuch as it tends to crea inmost, and foer in all, feelings of repugnance andcontempt for the colored race as degraded inferiors, whom they may, or must, treat as such. Thisis the staudard of morals and humanity, whichthose schools teach our children, who are thus hadto attach to color , sentiments and emotions,which should arise, is at all, only in view of charactor.     The only security we can have for a healthy andefficient system of public instruction  in the deepinterest and vigi care with which the more intellige watch ever the welfare of the scThis only will secure empetent teachers, ingable exertion, and a high standard of excellence,and where the colored children, are mingled withthe mass of their more favored fellows, they willpartaof the advantages of this watchful eversight.Sh out  separated, they are in be negted and to experience all the evils of an isolated andclases.             One of the great morits of our system of publicinstructions is, the  of all  which it preduces. From a childhood which shares the cameof arristo prejudice, or separate  andOur common school system suits our tions, promotes the feeling of brotherhood andthe habits of republi equality. To debar the coloredrace from these advantages, even if we still to them equal adtional results, is a injustice and wrong, and is taking the sur inof ptusting a prejudice, that should be depreofperpetuating a prejudice, that should be deprecatedand discounced by all intelligent andChristian men.                 Over a large postion of our country the coloredrace are subjected to the terrible condition of do-nestic servitude. In other portions, though dchared free, yet Statute Law in come, and popularopinion in others, render them only nominally so.In the State of Ohio their testimony is prohibitedin Courts of Law, and they are thus virtually outlawed. In the City of New-York, a license todrive his own truck for hire, is not permitted thecolored man. In the proverally religious Stateof Couse and in the no less proverly democ State of New Hampshire, but afew years since private schools for colored childrensers gentlemen of property and ading,? and sogeneral was th and them, the prejudice againstthe race, that the Law was powerless for protion, or for remdy.            Are we shocked at the ha which these samples of the many iniquities priupon the colored  exbiti? Let us bewarethen how we ch a principle that  to andthese results from which we receil; forthe  that can be claimed in gation of ourposition is of de only, and  smaller to which we  the principle to  Thesome reasons are reli upon to ex the strocitieswe have alluded to, which with us, are the truecauses, that demand parate schools.                   It is the especial province of School Commesto direct and aid the risg generation in edand morals, to guide and sheer the youthful mindoa ward and upward to wards a full and manly maturityand self-respect. In view of this bigh aim,can this Board consistently give its aid and nctionto an arrangement that necessarily tends to impairthese objects towards a portion of their oharge,and can it rightfully thus to minister to the ritwhich loudly proclaims the existence of degradationand demands its continuance.      We think this spirit is sufficiently modified andweakened to render it no longer necessary or exouble, if indeed it ever were necessary to obey itsdemands or be governed by its requirements. Buteven if the fact were not no, we, whose province isthe care of public instruction, are bound to rememberthat it is our duty to resist and lend our aid tocorrect, not to countenance and follow, popular deinsionswherever they may lead.  This City is now, we believe, the only place inthis Commonwealth, where any distinction existswith respect to color, in the common schools. We doubt not many members of this Board havebeen induced to countenance this distinction, anddecide for its continuance, from the fear, that theadmission of colored children into schools withwhite children, would cause a popular ferment, thatwould seriously iair the condition of the schools.  We believe this fear to be unfounded. The admissionof colored children indiscriminately withwhite children prevails in the schools of Salem,New Bedford, Nantucket and Lowell, where thegeneral feeling respecting colored people is doubtlesssimilar to what it is here. In Salem and Nantucket,the separate schools have recently beenabolished, and in New Bedford and Lowell, no distinctionhas ever been practiced with reference tocolor, in the schools. What is done in these towns,most of which have, we believe, a larger proportionalcolored population than Boston, we think mayafford some evidence that similar results may reasonablybe expected to follow here. We will offersuch evidence as we have been able to obtain withreference to this subject, from persons officiallyconnected with the schools in those places, bywhich it will be seen that separate schools cannotbe justified on the ground of expediency, that theyare not advantageous to the colored people, but thatthey were quite the reverse in those places. Intwo of the Primary schools of district 15 in thisCity, four colored children have attended at differeatperiods of time during the post few years. Ourconnection with those schools during the wholetime of their attendance, enables us to affirm, thatno difficulty occurred in consequence, and no noticewas taken of the circumstance except in a singleinstance. One third more than the averagenumber of colored children that now attend theaspirate schools, might, with perfect convenienceto themselves, be distributed in twenty of the Primaryschools, and average only three to eachschool. Considering what has occurred in district15, who can imagine that any inconvenience oroutcry worthy of serious notice would arise fromthe admission of such a small number of these children, or of even double this number into the schools?No doubt, however, there would be some complaintsif colored children were admitted into theschools. No doubt some parents would feel aggrieved, and the delicate sensibilities and aristocratieprejudices of others might be moved-but we dodoubt if we should meet with as much complaintupon the admission of colored children as we nowdo, respecting the admission of lrish children,which in many schools are sufficiently numerous togive tone and character to the school. That thesecomplaints would however, soon decline or dieout, especially if the district and local committeesshould discharge their duty with firmness temperedwith discretion and mildness, we see no reasonwhatever to doubt. Nor do we suppose the immeduateresults to the colored children would be verymarked or instantaneously apparent. Having adoptedthe just and true policy, we may safely trust tothe fidelity with which it should be conducted, andto a reasonable time, for its legitimate fruits, andthe good it will eventually accomplish. It has been seriously urged, against abolishingthese colored schools, that the grammar schoolcommittee sustain the relation of constituents to thiscommittee, that we are responsible to them are undertheir control in this matter, and that until theymove, or require this committee to move in thepremises we are not justified in entertaining thesubject. Such reasoning, however, can only serveto weaken the cause it is intended to sustain. Thepowers and duties of the two committees are, it isbelieved, entirely distinct, an independent, neitherhaving any control or check over the other, orover the schools placed within the sole and particularcharge of each.  Much reliance is also placed upon the fact that someforty or fifty years since, the colored people of thethen town of Boston, petitioned for a separateschool for their children, which after some demuron the part of the town, was granted upon conditionof their contributing towards its support, for eachchild attending. From this circumstance, a chargeis made against the present generation of coloredpeople that they are capricious, inasmuch as theynow wish to abolish the schools their fathers soughtto establish, and they are gravely rebuked andtaunted, as being 'unworthy descendants' of wortheysires as dishonoring the memories of the PrimusHall, Prince Saunders, and other magnates ofa 'glorious ancestry.' They do not, it is said, moreover,really wish, or expect, the change they nowpetition us to make, but they have suffered themselvesto because the dupes and tools of others,and at their instigation complain of an arrangementwhich they were once anxious to obtain, solely forthe purpose of making party capital for their instigators,and of furnishing a subject of agitation foranother purpose. The want of justice which characterizesthe latter of these two charges againstthem, and the contempt for the petitioners whichsuch an imputation implies, is too open, gross, andpalpable to require further comment, and we passto the former, the complaint of capriciousness. 'glorious ancestry.' The condition of the colored people fifty yearssince, when they had just escaped from the conditiesof slavery, and the universal feelings and opinionsof the white race respecting them, have both,now, because very much modified and changed.That, which was then a gain and an advantage,under circumstances which then existed, is now grievance under the circumstances which now exist.To permit a colored man to ride in a stagecoach instead of compelling him to go on foot, wasan advantage once, but it would be a grievance nowto compel him to travel by stage, when he can availhimself of a rail-road car for that purpose. Then,they were low in the nle of civilization and moralsin comparison with their condition nw. Thenthey were universally considered as too inferior toadmit of any decided advancement. Now, manyof them furnish abundant proof of the fallacy ofsuch an ides. Then, in Boston, they were fairgame for the dissolute, the thoughtless, and thewanton, to break all sorts of rude and unfeelingjests upon, and brutally to abuse and revile wheneverthey assumed any other character tha servantof servants, and humblest of the humble. Now,though something of this may perhaps still lingeramong us, it is no longer fashionable, or even reputable, to give it any very open or decided manifestation.To escape intolerable persecution and contept, they were once glad to he herded togetherby themselves. To partake of advantages they cannow peacefully enjoy they ask that their undoubtedright to do no, may no longer be withheld.     It is to be regretted flat on this question thereseems to prevail a proneness to raise f issues,rather than to acknowledge the true issues, andmanfully meet them. Far-fetched and futile reasoning, wholly irrelevant, is relied upon for justityingthe separate schools, while the true causes appearto be studiously avoided and kept out of sight.But no attempt to mystify the subject, no effort towarp the judgment by investigations or assertionsrespecting the discrepancies and characteristics ofdifferent races, will avail to cloak the real causesthat demand these caste schools least of all, can aphilosophic theory, more fanciful than sound, be reliedupon in this matter, to contradict the plainestdeductions of common sense and the uniform testimonyand experience of dally life. That the defenceof these schools should be mainly placed onthe ground, that it is solely for the goad of the coloredchildren, that they are confined to separateschools, is certainly matter of great surprise and astonishment.  Considering also the character and condition ofour seperate schools, as well as those which have  The appendix to the Report cental evldenceom members of the school Committees of theselaces coselwiveed.existed else-where, the for the colored children  and meralresults, than can be exposed for  childrenfrom the common schools,  truly no less -ishing.         The advocates and tors of slavery, drives fromevery other present to, nowunhesitatingly proclaims its peculiar adtion so tnegro race, and the grest advantages it  uponits victims, over any good that  possibly accrueto them front a state of freedom.       It is to be hoped that the phy of which slavery teaches, may bet be out guide, by the Primary School Board of the cityof Boston, and the  putforth, and the same necessity assigned  thesecaste schools, that are urged in defce of the —peculairinstitution;—  primary inction withus, is to take the same  that ur plitied andecelesisstical arrang northern subserviency, and southern  willboth be complete, and the rising generation canhardly help being thoroughly imbued with the moraland political code of the nation, as "established inchurch and state.'              It is no notoriously tr however, and so palpablyapparent, that the red children are  outof the common schools solely by reason of the objectionon the part of many of the white citizens, tohave their children attend thame schools with thecolored children, that it is entirely superfluous todwell on this fact. The negro pew, the Jim Crowcar, and the caste school, unquestionably owe theirorigin to one and the same cause, and a labored effortto show this cause to be an honest regard forthe best interests of the colored people, should meetwith the tempt which is due to gross and deliberatemisrepresentation.      We consider the position of this Board in relationto these schools to be entirely wrong and altogethernjustifiable. The claims of humanity, thedemands of justice, and the requirements of conscience,all, call earnestly and distinctly, for an abatementof this evil.  If we have succeeded in making ourselves understood,it will be seen that we oppose any distinctionwhatever being made on the ground of color orrace, and that all applicants for admission into theprimary schools, whether white or black, should,according to the rule for white children, recentlyadopted by this Board, be 'especially entitled toenter the school nearest his or her place of residence.' Inasmuch however as decided and conflictingopinions exist, with regard to the best method ofbrining about this result, some deeming it moreadvisable to adopt gradual means for abolishingthese caste schools, we have judged proper to offerthe following VOTE for consideration. VOTED, that such of the colored inhabitants asmay prefer sending their children to the separateschools, shall be peritted to do so; and that thosewho may choose to send their children to the otherschools nearest their place of residence shall be entitledto send them, and that it is the duty of thelocal committee to grant permits in conformitywith this rule. OTED  This course, if taken, will no doubt satisfy thoseof the colored people who fell aggrieved by beingobliged to send their children to the separateschools, or forego all advantages of public unstruction,—and it will relieve the Board from a troublesomequestion, which will portably be continuallypressed upon its consideration until some subatatailchange is made; for it cannot be supposed thatso gross an outrage upon the rights and interestsof even the lowest in the community will be quietlysubmitted to. If as is confidently asserted, none ofthe colored people wish for or will accept anychange, the schools will remain precisely as theyare now, if the vote is passed, and no harm certainlywill be done. If we might be permitted, with all respect, to offera single suggestion to those who labor to retainthese caste schools, which are an offence to humanity, and an obstruction in the path of progress,snail-paced though it may be, of the colored race, itwould be this,—to examine closely and estimatefairly, the motives and reasons that impel them tothis labor. If this should be done with a singleness of purpose, and a manly determination to abide by theresult of such an analysis, we cannot doubt the decisionwill be correct, that it will meet the publicsanction, and what is better, that of an approvingconscience. We have trespassed upon time, and perhaps haveexhausted patience, by our inability to be more briefand less tedious, not withstanding we have rejectedmuch that pressed for utterance, and avoided alldesire to multiply words. Towards those who entertainopposing views, and who advocate a totallydifferent course, we claim to entertain no other thanrespectful regard. And while we have characterizedthe position taken, and the reasons put forth tosustain them, as we think only fairly and truly,others perhaps may deem, that we have been uncharitable, unjust, and fanatical. For such discrepancy, there is no remedy, savewhat may be derived from the exercise of candor,charity and good sense, which we hope may alwaysabound in our deliberations. However otherwisewe may be judged, we cannot admit that the convictiouswe have uttered and the positions we haveendeavored to sustain, are justly liable to the chargeof party cant, or of sickly sensibility towards thecolored race, but may more properly be consideredas prompted by self-respect, and the result of only acommon regard for justice and humanity, whilethey are amply supported by every consideration ofreason, and every dictate and duty of Christianity.
