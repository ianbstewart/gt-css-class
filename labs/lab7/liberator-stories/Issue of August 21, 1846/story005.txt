 We we if it would be possible for a manwho has 'himself ac gr, or 'hadg thru upon ' by birth or other adventitiouscircumstances, to deliver an Address our good City of Boston, chiming in with the prevailingnotions of community, without having itlauded to the skies by the almost universal newspaperpress, however inconclusive his arguments,or wishy-washy his positions.        Somebody says, or ought to my, that 'An independentPress is the surest safeguard of freedom.'Were such independence in Boston the price ofour general liberty, a sorry freedom we should beenjoying. Every newspaper here, secular or religions, with but two or three exceptions we believe,have spoken in eulogistic terms of Mr. FLETCHERWSTER'S Fourth of July Oration—and yet itseems to us to be open to many and great exceptions, both in its principles and in its deductions.We have no time or room, nor should hardly possessthe ablity, to give to a thorough and critical examination—but a sentence in it, which has just metour eye, strikes us as a most signal instance of inconclusivenessin reasoning—a strong case of whatlogicians would call petition princip, or, in commonparlance, 'begging the question.' He says:— r. LETCHER STER'S  petition princip  To pat away our arms, and to render ourselvespowerless, to invite aggression and insult , is not theway to begin the introduction of universal peace.' The position is here assumed, if we understandthe force of language, that to 'put away our armsis 'to reader ourselves powerless, and to invite aggression'—and here we take issue with the belligerentorator. It has been proved—and the contraryto it never s been and never can be—that thesurest way for individuals or communities to repelinsult and aggression, and to secure lasting pence,is to be openly understood as acting on the Christianprinciple of non-resistance of evil—so to'please the Lord,' by 'forbearing one another, andforgiving one another in love,' that he 'maketheven our enemies to be at peace with us.'  The early history of the Colony of Pennsylvaniais a striking illustration of the safety to individualsof the open profession and the consistent practiceof peace principles, and of the danger of even atemporary departure from them. In the midst ofthe most savage Indian massacres, the persons andproperty of the unarmed Quakers—a great majoriityof the whole population—were uniformly safe.—While slaughter was rife around them, it is givenas a historical fact that but three individuals ofthese followers of the 'things that make for peace'were at all molested—and these solely by a distrustof, and departure from, their pacific principles—by found with arms in their hands.Similar to this, even in more turbulent times, wasthe result of the 'Irish Rebellion' as it regardedthe security of those whom Mr. Webster woulddesignate as 'powerless' Quakers. The safety of Peace principles and practice, tothe Pennsylvania community, for the first seventyyears of its associated existence, was quite as fullytested, in the midst of the half dozen savage tribes,warring with each other, and with any and all thewhites who were ready and willing to do battlewith them—and it was not until the policy of Wm.Penn was departed from, and an armed force institutedfor the maintenance of Government, that theColony was left to suffer, even in apprehension,from the ravages of war. We can only add, in conclusion, the followingsignificant extract, with reference to Pennsylvania,from the writings of JONATHAN DYMOND:— ONATHAN YMOND 'The only national opportunity which the virtueof the Christian world has afforded us of ascertainingthe safety of relying upon God for defence, hasdetermined that it is safe. Here are a people whoabsolutely refused to fight, and who incapacitatedthemselves for resistance by refusing to possess arms,and these were the people whose land, amid thesurrounding broils and slaughter, was elected asa land of security and peace.'  absolutely refused to fight incapacitatedthemselves for resistance by refusing to possess arms Remember:—One grog shop will make more cri-inals than a church or a penitentiary o reform.—Ex.

If, writer of the above would tell us how manycriminals each of the three named places annuallymade, his information might be rendered useful.Some of the greatest scoundrels we ever heard orserved their apprenticeship either in the Church orthe Penitentiary and we confess we have no greatfaith in the reformatory power of either. Fair play isa jewel. If the grog-shop manufactures criminals,let us know it, but don't try to make us believe thatthe Church and Penitentiary exerts no influence butto reform them—that would be exalting these institutionsunduly.

THE FRUITS OF ANNEXATION.—The war withMexico, with its long rain of evils, is the smallestportion of the vast price which the nation is madeto pay for Texas. By a skilfully adjusted policyto increase Southern means of warring against theNorth, it has secured a power in Congeries whichenables it to overturn the settled policy of the nation, and to beggar more millions than it has thou-nds of voters. With nine thousand voters, it hastwo Representatives; while Districts in the North,with thirteen thousand voters, have but one. ItsSeniors, representing nine thousand, nullify thevotes of Pennsylvania with four hundred thousand.If the tariff be repealed, it will be by Texas votes.Should new States be carved out of Mexico, the -premacy of the slave system will be fixed and absolute. The vast majority of the American peoplewill be subjugated by the intrigues and boldness ofa feeble minority of slaveholders, warring againstindustry as if it were dishonor. How long such astate of things would be endured it is not difficult toimagine.—Phil. North American. HE RUITS NNEXATION.   subjugated Phil. North American.
