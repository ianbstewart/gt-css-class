 Slavery is contrary to the fundamental principlesof morality. It neglects the great primary distinctionof persons and things; converting a personinto a thing, an object merely passive, without anyrecognized attributes of human nature. A slave is,in the eye of the state which stamps him with thatcharacter, not acknowledged as a man. His pleasuresand pains, his wished and desires, his needsand springs of action, his thoughts and feelings, areof no value whatever in the eye of the community.He is reduced to the level of the brutes. Even hiscrimes, as we have said, are not acknowledged aswrongs, lest it should be supposed that as he maydo a wrong, he may suffer one. And as there arefor him no wrongs, because there are no rights, sothere is for him nothing morally right; that is, aswe have seen, nothing conformable to the supremerule of human nature; for the supreme rule of hiscondition is the will of his master. He is thus divestedof his moral nature, which is contrary to thegreat principle we have already laid down, that allmen are moral beings—a principle which, we haveseen, is one of the universal truths of morality, whetherit be taken as a principle of justice or of humanity. It is a principle of justice, depending uponthe participation of all in a common humanity; it a principle of humanity, as authoritative and cogentas the fundamental idea of justice.  There is one defence of negro slavery, which reresentsthe negro as being inferior to the whiteman in his faculties. He is asserted to approachin his nature to the inferior animals; and hence itis inferred  he may he possessed as a thing,like the animals. But this defence is manifestlyquite baseless. The same faculties of mind haveappeared in the negro, as in the white, an fur as thecondition of our negro nations and negro classes hasafforded opportunities for their development. Thenegroes do not appear to he duller, ruler or coarser,in mind or in habits, than many savage white -tions; or than nations, now highly cultured, were,in their early condition. The negro has a moralnature, and is therefore included in the consequenceswhich follow from the principle, that all menhave a common nature. The negro has the sameaffections and springs of action as we ourselves.He loves his wife, his children, his home, and anysecurity and stability which is granted him. Hecan buy and sell, promise and perform. He has, asmuch as any race of men, moral sentiments. Hecan admire and love what is good, he can condemnand hate what is had. He has the sentiment ofrights and wrongs, also. Though the how allowshim no rights, he can feel bitterly the monstrouswrong of the haw. His reason is the universal reasonof men. He understands the general and abstreetforms in which language presents the objectsand rules, with which reason deals. He recogni-s, as we do, a supreme rule of human action andhuman being; for like us, he can direct his thoughts to what is absolutely rights. In short, thereis no  which can he need, describing the moraland rational nature of man, which way not be as of the wh. The  the white and the ny  which one can found a right to of the other, .               Again in states where negro waves are n,  there to write or read is for bylaw, under the  penalties. Such laws supposethe capacity of negroes for intel;and are an inflicts ion that it is necessary todegrade their minds, in order to keep their bodiesin slavery. When such practices and such lawsprevail. To defend negro slavery by ing the insororityof the negro race, can hardly be free fromthe guilt of willful blindness of co, pin, in order to uphold conscious wrong.           The Moralist, then, must pronounce slavery to besserly inconsistent with humanity and with pr, which, being from the al re on may be ed fundamental prles of.  to the ssenceof lity, and  be looked upon as a lerablecondition of society, nor acquiesced in as whatmay allowably be. Whenever slavery exists, itsabolition must be one of the great objects of everygood man. — Dr. WHEWELL.               HEWELL.
