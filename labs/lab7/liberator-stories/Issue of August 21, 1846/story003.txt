 It gives us pleasure to announce to those abe- litionists of Easters Pennsylvania who were unfor- tunately prevented from attending our annual mee- ting and, also, to friends abroad, that the meeting was fraught with deep interest, that it betokened a healthy state of feeling in our ranks, and promised good to the cause. We wish that all our fellow la- bor in this field, th who are to share with us the  of the uing year, had been there to par- ticip in its invigorating influences. A more sat- isfactory meeting has, perhaps, never been held by the Society. Its numbers were estimated to exceed those of the very large gathering of last year. Al- though this was not its most important feature, it is valuable, as it disproved the prediction, origina- ted by the hopes of opposers, and the fears of timid friends, that the position taken by the Society at its last meeting would greatly dinish our num- bers, and reduce to an unenviable minority, those who adhered to its prinici. Had the develop- ments of the present year proved the truth, instead of the fehood, of this prediction, our confidence in the wisdom and truth of the Society a position, would have been, in no wise, diminished. But while we firmly believe that, by adhering to a righteous principle, we think it a cause of greater joy, when the ten thousand won to the truth, and join with us in its propaga- tion.         Not the least interesting feature of our meeting was the general harmony which prevailed is its counsels. The result of the last annual meeting having determined the character and position of the Society, the sterner controversies needful then, to the establishment of a great principle, were not now required, and the Society, having already laid proceeded to build a fstructure thereon.  Several fellow-laborers in other States who de- sired to attend our annual convocation and give us a word of sympathy and cheer, were unable to do so. Our friend Adin Ballou, of Massachusetts, was present, and his assistance was highly valuable. The friends of the cause at home, brought with them to the meeting those most important requisites for carrying on a moral enterprise, warm hearts and energetic purposes. The first session of the meeting was held in the Friends' Meeting House at Old Kennett, but therapidly increasing audience made it necessary toadjourn to the yard around the meeting house,where, in the shade of the spreading tress, the remainderof the sessions were held. They werecontinued three days, and the interest was unabatedto the last. The subject of raising funds for carryingon the operations of the next year, claimed theearly attention of the meeting, and the result ofthis attention was the collection of a much largeramount in cash and pledges, than was obtainedlast year. The duty of abstinence from the -chase and use of the products of slave-labor was theone session. It was faithfully and zealously urgedby many speakers and found few opponents.  We may mention by the way, that during themeeting, a banner bearing the following inscriptionwas suspended from one of the trees, in sight ofthe congregation:. 'No Union with Slaveholders! Slave labor is the foundation of slavery. The consumer is as guilty as the holder'Send back the goods!They are the price of blood.Come out of the Church!She is the strong hold of sin.'       The Society did not neglect the duty of recording its testimony against the present war which our country is waging against Mexico, for the extension and perpetuation of American slavery. The oppo- sition of few individuals—we ought rather to say of the single individual—to the resolution proposed on this subject, did not avail to win the Society from its integrity, or to blind its eyes to the true charac- ter and design of this infamous war; a character so plainly inscribed upon it from its commencement, that he who runs may read it. That theory of expediency, as it is sometimes termed, which denies the existence of abstract right and wrong, and of any immutable moral principle, —a theory as morally pernicious as it is philosophi- cally false—was occasionally advanced in opposi- tion to resolutions involving some rigid principle, but it met with severe and merited condemnation and rebuke. expediency Justice to the Society requires a few words of ex- placations relative to the disposal of the resolution condemning the course of Cassius M. Clay. This resolution, as will be seen on the minutes, was adopted on the second day of the meeting. Very few votes were given against it. At a late hour of the last session of the meeting, after a large number of the members of the society had left, a motion for its reconsideration prevailed, and it was laid on the table; a large minority voting against such a dispo- sal of it. It is believed that others than members o, the Society voted on this motion, no doubt, thought- lessly, and it is known that some who gave it an af- firmative vote, did not regard it as a final disposal of the resolution. The whole matter will be regard- ed by some, as of no great importance, still it is but just to state the facts of the case. Our meeting closed satisfactorily and pleasantly. The parting words of our highly esteemed brother, Adin Ballon, nk deep into many a heart, and will be treasured for future use, in hours when the plea- sent and healthful stimulus of an anti-slavery meet- ing may be wanting, and the path of duty may seem wearisome and long.
