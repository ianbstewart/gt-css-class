 Europe never knew the festering sores which ex.isted in her midst, till Howard opened the prisondoors. All England was startled by the revelationswhich the wand of Dickens elicited, in relation tojails and work houses. In humble imitation of thesame spirit, we make the following extracts from therecent Report of Messrs. Crowell, Ingraham, andKimball, to the Primary School Committee of Boston,touching separate colored schools, to show what weakdeluded creatures still exist in our very midst. Forthe sake of friends at a distance, we will add, thatthose on the spot can hardly decide whether the wri-ters ate weak enough to believe what they say, orare merely wickedly pretending to do so to serve apurpose. The Report begins with an attempt to invalidatethe position of the petitioners, that the separateschools are contrary to law, and to show that analogousdistinctions are made among white scholars. Certainschools are for the benefit only of those qualified forthem These are the Latin, the High and the Smithschools! The qualification for the two first in profi-ciency. What is the qualification of the last, themajority thus proceed to set forth: qualified High Smith qualification We should not think it necessary to deny, wereit not so often and so confidently asserted, thatthe principle, on which the separate schools for co-lored children are maintained, is that of complexion,merely. The public have been told, over and over,that a dark or lighter colored skin, is made theground of separating children, and of placing thema different schools. And we have become fami-liar with the taunt, that it might be difficult to decide-on the requisite degree of ebony which achild's pigment must possess, in order to entitlehim to the distinction of a colored child. But thisa not the ground of distinction. It is one of races,not of colors, merely. The distinction is one whichthe All-wise Creator has seen tit to establish; andit is founded deep in the physical, mental, and mor-al natures of the two races. No legislation, no so-cial customs, can efface this distinction. complexion, races The two races of men, who differ most widely,are the Anglo-Saxon and the native of Western andSouthern Africa. We need not take upon us, here,to say which is the superior, or which the inferior,race; we only state a notorious and undeniablefact. If either race be superior to the other, it fol-lows, according to the law of Christian benevo-lence, that the strong ought to hear the infirmitiesof the weak: but the fact still remains. Now it, in the opinion of the School Committee,here is a race not only distinct in respect to color,hair, and general physiognomy, but possessing phy-sical, mental, and moral peculiarities, which rendera promiscuous intermingling in the public schoolsdisadvantageous, both to them and to the whites, —what law of the Statute book is to prevent themfrom maintaining special schools for their instrction?-Is not this as clearly within the discretionarypowers committed to them by the law, as any ofthose acts before referred to? Those who have soconfidently appealed to the opinions of eminentcounsel, learned in the law, whose opinions we cer-tainly respect as highly as they can do, will do wellto bear in mind, that their opinions do not coverthis point. And for good reasons: it have neverbeen decided in any of our courts of law. It is nota res adjudicata. It is a point, on which plain men,of common sense, although not lawyers, may venhaveto form an opinion. We will present this point in another light. Aneminent Counsellor in this Commonwealth has giv-en a written Opinion, on being officially applied to,that the School Committee of Salem have no law-ful power to execute the colored children from thepublic free schools.' If by this be meant that theSchool Committee of Salem have no right to pro-vide special schools for colored children, and toexclude them from the other schools, (and this iscertainly the utmost extent of its meaning,) it doesnot necessarily follow, that the Boston School Com-mittee have not the legal power to do so. Theremay be no other city or town in the Commonwealth,in which colored children are found in sufficientnumbers, or where they live sufficiently compact,to be advantageously gathered into special and se-oarate schools; and therefore it may be quite ille-gal in Nantucket, or Newburyport, or New Bed-ford, or Salem. to maintain such schools, yet quitelegal, right, expedient, wise, and liberal, to main-tain them in Boston. Other considerations, arisingfrom social customs and the condition of publicfeeling, might confirm this position. In order, therefore, to make out that the coloredchildren of Boston, gathered in schools of sufficientnumbers, and taught by instructors equally compe-tent with those in the schools for white children, donot enjoy the benefit of the free schools equallywith others,' it must be shown, that they are inferi-or in capacity to the white children, or that theirtendencies are downward. We do not, say this;but we maintain, that those, who affirm that thecolored children are depressed by being kept inseparate schools, do say it. Did our pilgrim fathersbecome depressed, and degenerate, by keeping dis-tinct from the aboriginal Narragansetts and Pe-quods, in whose country they were but strangersand sojourners? We would ask these far-sightedobservers of human events to look over into Africa,or India, and tell as whether the few Anglo-Saxons,who are mingled among the natives of those countriestries, are depressed, in consequence of keeping separatefrom them? Let fact and common sensetake the place of abstract theories.' We The legal gentlemen who appeared before yourCommittee as Counsel for the Petitioners, laboredmuch to show that the effect of separate schools forcolored children is to impair their social standing.The argument urged, was, that ?it will not do to saythat we give the colored child a good opportunityfor education. He has the right to be mingled in,and crumbled up with, the mass of society in whichhe lives. Education includes all this. It is thehumanizing, socializing influence of the school sys-tem, which is its most important feature.' This as a part of the legal argument, was notentirely convincing to your Committee. They donot believe that the law was intended to regulateour social customs, nor to oblige us, or our children,or any other children, colored or white, to associatewith, or be 'crumbled up' among, any class ofpeople, except those to whom it may be naturallyagreeable.' 'And in the first place, if all the colored peopleamong us were unanimous in the prayer of thisPetition, ought it to be granted? In reply to thisquestion, we must any, that, in our opinion, theless the colored and white people become inter-mingled, the better it will be for both races. Weare deeply impressed with the importance of thisopinion, yet neither the proper limits of this Report,nor the occasion, will permit us to presentthe considerations which might be given in supportof it. We maintain, that the true interests ofboth races require, that they should be kept dis-tinct. Amalgamation is degradation. We wouldurge on our brethren of the African race, the dutyof cultivating the genuine virtues, peculiar to thatrace. Is it degrading to them to be unmingledwith their pale-faced neighbors? Confound thetongue that would utter such slander upon them!Let them not lean upon, nor look up to, whites;but trust, under God, to their own native energies,unmingled and uncorrupted. Let them cultivatea respect for themselves, for their own race, theirown blood, aye, and for their own color. Let themnot come to us with the humiliating confession,that they cannot make their separate schools asgood as those for the white children; and tell usthat their children, if put by themselves, even underthe instruction, must sink, unless they havethe white children to pull them up. We will notbelieve this, we pronounce it a stander on the coloredpeople; but we do say, that this course ofpolicy will never elevate them, nor cause them tobe respected.  color.  We are bound, too, to consult the interests of thewhite children. Even if the colored childrenwould be the gainers by the proposed change, weare bound to ask, whether the white children willnot be in an equal degree, at least, the losers? Itis quite obvious, that disagreements and troubles,of various kinds, would immediately arise, if thechange should be made, and that much injurywould be done to the schools. How serious itwould be, it is impossible to say. It is probable,too, that the attendance of the colored childrenwould, in the aggregate, be seriously diminished.And we are unable to see that any good would accrue, to counterbalance these evils. 'While, therefore, your Committee maintain,that the reasonable request, of even one coloredparent, should be scrpulously respected, yet wealso maintain, that if ?the greatest good of thegreatest number? will be promoted by our presentarangement, it ought to be retained. If these separateschools were abolished, and the colored children-were mingled promiscuously in the otherschools, she white children would not cordially with them. The whites would vex andinsult the colored children, who would retort byblows, and thus continual quarrels would arise. Itis also certain that many scholars would be drivenfrom our schools by such a change. Many parentswould not suffer their children to associate withcolored children; and these, too, from among theclass who most need instruction: for the prejudicesagainst color are strongest among the most ignorant. Another consequence would be, to impairthe present high standing of our schools, by introducinga cause of discord, which would drive a waysome of the best scolars.'   The Report then goes on to show, that the avarage absences of the colored scholars is greater thanthat of the white scholars, and that their truant dispositionin mixed schools, might, peradventure, corruptand lead away their innocent companions! Itproceeds to give a history of the colored schools, andto show that they were originally established at therequest of the colored people themselves. The Committeethereupon refresh themselves with the followingebullition of eloquence. 'The question arises, by what means the viewsand feelings of the colored people, in reference tothese special schools for their benefit, have been somysteriously changed. The Petition now beforeyour Committee holds the following very exortantlanguage: ?The establishment of separateschools for our children is believed to be unlawful,and it is felt to be, it not in intention, in fact, insulting.' Is this the kind return of the present generationof colored men, to the City of Boston, forgranting the petition of their sires? After spendingfar more money for the education of the coloredchildren, in proportion, than for the childrenof her white citizens, in the very way in which itwas asked, is the mificence of this, perhaps toogenerous, certainly too indulgent City, to be declaredinsulting? Unworthy successors of PrimusHall, of Cyrus Vassall, and of Prince Saunders!  insulting.  insulting The Committee then count the noses of the childrenof the signers of the Petition, and infer fromthe result, that the colored people do not desire anychange. As if this were not a question of principleand general interest, and not confined to those whohave children to send. And, moreover, there aretwenty of these who have children and do not sendthem to the primary schools; and sixteen of thenumber of whose progeny the Committee were notcompetent to speak, but who do not send any toschool. The Committee infer from this an argumentin favor of their side of the question. But is it notequally fair to infer that these actual or possiblechildren are deprived of the benefits of primary schooleducation, or receive it privately, because their parentswill not sent them to the Committee'sSchools? twenty The Committee then grow sententiously severe,and 'quote Scripture for purpose,' as Shakspearehas told us, is often done in similar circumstances: grow 'In view of these facts, your Committee mustnot only be permitted to say, that this Petition doesnot, in their opinion, represent the wishes of the coloredpeople of Boston, but to express their astonishmentbow it came to be presented as such. Thatsuch a Petition was started, and that efforts weremade to obtain signers, is a cause of no surprise;and your Committee would certainly be wantingin penetration, if they did not think of the questionwhich King David put to the wise woman of Tekoah, 'Is not the hand of Jab with th in allthis?' We are confident that a full investigationof the facts would show, that this Petition did notoriginate in the wishes of the colored people,—certainlynot in those of the real and unmingled Africanrace. not Jab   not This conclusion is tained by the uniform testimonyof gentlemen who have had the best opportunitiesof knowing the sentiments of the coloredpeople, through a long series of years. A gentlemanof high standing in this City, long and intimatelyacquainted with our Schools, says, 'Duringmy connection of more than sixteen years withyour Board, two thirds of which was devoted tothe charge of one of the Schools for colored children, I never heard a word of complaint from thatclass of people against separate schools. If left totheir own judgment, I have no doubt they wouldprefer them.'  never Your Committee, therefore, after a careful, and,as they believe, a dispassionate survey of all thefacts, can see no sufficient reasons, either in law,in justice, or in charity, for the proposed change.They do not believe that the colored childrenwould be benefited, but, on the contrary, that theywould be very seriously injured by it. If it beasked, as it has sometimes been, Why not let thecolored people be their own judges in this matter?We reply, that there is no satisfactory proof thatthey desire a change; and if they do, it is by nomeans certain that they understand their true inter-else why this apparent fickleness? The coloredchildren, instead of being 'deprived of thoseequal privileges and advantages in the PublicSchools to which they are entitled, as citizens,' enjoyeven greater privileges than any others; and itcosts the City much more, in proportion, to educateits colored, than its white children. They areunder the same regulations and supervision, receiveas much, and usually name of the  of theCommittee, their Teachers rank as high, and arepaid as much, as those for white children. In whatrespect, then, are their privileges a bridged?  itin associating who each other? Do colored ple conta colored people by being-together?Suppose there were but one , and very small any, for having colored children in rate schools;—what reason in there agWe ask these question, with the tenderest regardfor the rights and the feelings of the colored people.'    are paid much         The conclusion of the whole ,matter, we give inthe words of the Committee, themselves, withoutabridgement. 'It must be obvious, to every one who candidlyconsiders these facts, that there is no occasion for saychange in the Rules or in the policy this Board, in referencetoour Schools for colored children. We didnot originate the system. It was established long ago,—even before the Primary Schools themselveswere established,—at the earnest and repeated requestof the colored people who were deeply impressedwith its importance and necessity, as were theirmost judicious friends. Nor can any one, whowill take the pains to acquaint himself with facts,doubt, that the reasons for the continuance of thesespecial Schools, are even stronger than thosewhich led to their establishment. We would urgethe colored people and their friends to cases fromthese useless assaults upon the separate Schools,and to unite their efforts with ours, to improve themin every possible way, so that any child would feelit to be, not a disparagement but and honor to belongto them; and to brand that man, colored orwhite, as an enemy, and a slanderer, who shallhereafter say, that these special Schools are, eitherin intension of fact, degrading or insulting to thecolored people. The conclusion, to which these considerationshave led us we now submit, as the principles bywhich, in our opinion, the future proceedings of theBoard, on this subject, ought to be guided. It is admitted, That colored children, or the decendants of theAfrican race, have a right to all the benefits of thePublic Schools, equally with other children: That the Committee have no right to place themin inferior schools, (as was the case in Salem andNantucket,) by fixing the salary of the Teachers appointedfor them at a lower rate than the Teachersof white children receive: That we have no right to classify or assign themin such a manner as, either intentionally or necessarily, to depress or degrade them. What we claim, is, That, under the law giving to the School Committee'the general charge and superintendence ofall the public schools,' and the power to 'determinethe number and qualification of the scholarsto be admitted into the school,' the Committee leavethe right to distribute, assign, and classify, all children, belonging to the schools in the City, accordingto their best judgment: That it is legal and expedient, in a populous andcompact city like Boston, to carry out the principlesof classification more minutely than in any other places: (In country towns, scholars of all ages, fromfour to sixteen, or even to twenty, are placed in thesame school. In Boston, we assign children to thePrimary Schools, or to the Grammar Schools, accordingto age. In the Schools for Special Instruction, children are assigned, either according to theircapacities, or according to their early advantages,or according to their ages. In the Schools for girlsor for boy, exclusively, the children are assignedaccording to sex. Yet the School Committee, inBoston, are under the same law as the Committeesin country towns. Does the law forbid the assigningof children in schools according to a distictionin races, or even in color, any more than ofsex, or age, or different degrees of attainment?): That in the exercise of the same discretionarypower, they have a right to establish a school fortruants, another for stubborn children, and anotherfor those who are irregular and inconstant is theirattendance; if, in their judgment, the interests ofthe schools require them: That Boston is but one 'school district,' so far asthe legal question is concerned: and therefore, That we may send either of these classes of childrento any school in the City, unless their residencebe so remote, that it can be proved, to thesatisfaction of the judicial tribunals, that they areon that account, unnecessarily deprived of theirfair share in the benefits of school instruction. In applying these principles to the case of coloredchildren, we maintain, 1. That their peculiar physical, mental, and moralstructure, requires an educational treatment, different, in some respects, from that of white children.Teachers of schools in which they are intermingledremark, that, in those parts of study and instructionin which progress depends on memory or on theimitative faculties, chiefly, the colored children willoften keep pace with the white children; but, whenprogress comes to depend chiefly on the facultiesof invention, comparison, and reasoning, they quicklyfall behind. 2. That the number of colored children in Boston, is so great that they can be advantageouslyplaced in separate schools, where all needful stimulus, arising from number and competition, may befelt, without their being degraded or discouraged. 3. That they live so compactly, that in very few(if in any) cases, is it at all inconvenient to attendthe special Schools provided for them. 4. That the facts connected with, the origin andhistory of these Schools, show that, without them,the colored people would have remained ignorantand degraded, and very few would have beenfound in the Schools. 5. That if these special Schools were now bolished, the number of colored children in the PublicSchools would be greatly diminished, while seriousinjury would also be done to the other Schools,and no benefit would result.  6. That the majority of the colored and most ofthe white people, prefer the present system. As, then, there is no statute, nor decision of thecivil Courts, against classifying children in schoolsaccording to a distinction in races, color, or mentaland physical peculiarities, the Committee believethat we have the right to classify on these princeples; nor do they believe, that, by so doing, we defeatthe intent, or violate the spirit of the law, theConstitution, or the invaluable common-school systernestablished by our fathers; nor in any way infringethe rights of the colored child, or degradethe colored people, these Schools were establishedfor their special benefit; for the same reason wewould have them vigorously sustained. No man,colored or white, who understands their real valueto the colored people, would seek their destruction. White, therefore, your Committee propose nochange in the policy of this Board, they recommendthe adoption of the annexed Resolutions, as expressiveof their opinions. Respectfully submitted,WILLIAM CROWELL,JOSEPH W. INGRAHAM,DAVID KIMBALL. Resolved, That, in the opinion of this Board, thecontinuance of the separate Schools for coloredchildren, and the regular attendance of all suchchildren upon, those Schools, is not only legal andjust, but is best adapted to promote the educationof that class of our population.'
