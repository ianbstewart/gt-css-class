 This day is the anniversary of Emancipation inthe British West Indies, the greatest deed, so far, ofthe present century. Cannot we of the UnitedStates show a greater one before the century isgone, in the emancipation of the millions upon ourown soil? Can there be another half century ofslavery here? No! nor a quarter of a century.—New annexations, though they may postpone, cannotprevent the great consummation. Anti-slaverysentiments have made immense progress withinten years. About the time George Thompson washere, the mob ruled the day. We recollect that inthis city some demonstrations of a mob-spirit wereshown, which were rebuked by some of the newspapersand a public meeting, and the Southernnewspapers began to talk seriously of a non-intercoursebetween their section and our own town.They threatened not to buy any more cottons of us!and the tone of the Northern press, in many cases,encouraged them in this. Boston men—the ablestand richest of them—held public meetings to denouncethe abolitionists. How is it now? Thetone of the press and the people and the church, allshow a different state of things. The politiciansare obliged to defer to the new public sentiment.—The be sure the political servility of the North tothe South was never greater than at present; butthat has now about reached its height, or depth.—The turning point is almost reached, and a veryfew years will witness a swifter change in the politicsof the country than has ever yet been effected,and in proportion to its former servility to the South,will be the North's independence of it. Everythingshadows forth this. Every new hostile measureforced upon us by the slave-power, but goodsthe patient North so action, which will come seenwith terrible force. The sooner the better, my we. It is mery with some people—a great manypeople, laded—to  that the English dve credit for their  act, and they talk whirs slaves at home, in the on milks  sheco. Very well; we great that the peoof d are d with evils, but shall prevent our giving the credit for the glorious of the first of August? It in not sufficiently -ed that this was the work of the people, andnot of the ocracy. Upon this point, the remarksby Mr. Quincy in the Liberator, are very true andexcellent, and with them we leave the subject, hopingto be able on Monday to give some acnt of thecelebration of the anniversary at Concord,—LowellJournal.
