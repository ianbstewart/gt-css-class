 We have placed on our fist page copious extreats—all that appeared to us essential to a fair understandingof its character—from the report of themajority of the Committee on these schools, to thePrimary School Committee. We have also givesthe whole of the minority Report. This we havedone, partly on account of its intrinsic excellence,partly because its length rendered its entire insertionpossible, and partly because the majority of the Committeerefused to print it in connection with theirown! So that it seemed but fair that we should endevourto make the public what amends we can, byall the circulation which the Liberator can give to soadmirable a document. Whatever may be thought of themagnanimity ofthe majority of the Committee, in this treatment ofthe minority, no one, after reading the Report whichthey refused to print, one entertain the lighteetdoubt of their discretion. Never did the accumulateingcobwebs of sluttish years disappear more swiftlyor more effectually before the stalwart broom of anotable house-maid, than do the flimsy yet vesomoussophistries of the majority before the destr-tive thrusts of the besome the minority. The demolitionis complete. We cannot, indeed, promise ourselvesthat they will not be spun again, for this is amanufacture which needs no tariff for its protection.But they are brushed away for the present. magnanimity  discretion.   And, indeed, this refusal on the part of the majorityproves them to be posed of a degree of intelligence, or, at least, of instinct, which would not beinferred from the production they have sanctioned.For, it implies what is not always true of persons intheir predicament, that they know that they areknocked down, and are, not unnaturally, indisposedto assist in the farther process of 'dragging themselvesout.' And it is not unlikely that a propersense of public economy entered into the decision.For, after they had been at the pains to write themselvesdown in the chapter of natural history to whichthey seemed properly to belong, it might well appearto them an extravagant piece of superogation toprint, at the public expense, Mr. Edmund Jackson'striumphant demonstration of the very truth they hadthemselves so satisfactorily established.  The public schools are one of the stereotypedboasts of New England. And especially have theBoston schools been the theme of no small self-complacencyand self-laudation to the burghers, eversince they were established. A year or two since,Dr. Howe instituted a process for ascertaining theactual progress of the pupils, the results of whichwere somewhat startling, and are doubtless fresh inthe minds of our city readers. He was left out ofthe Committee the next year, for his pains, and thegood old state of things maintained, to the great satisfactionof teachers and taught. But the developmentswhich have been made within the last twoyears, as to the moral and intellectual condition ofthe Committee which presides over the public instruction, certainly makes that of the childrencease to be remarkable. It is no wonder that thechildren should have made the grotesque answersthey did to Dr. Howe's interrogatories, when theirpublic guardians have recorded this extraordinary responseto the simple asking of the petitioners. Thoughthe mental state of the children, as shown in theiranswers, might be the more comical, that of theCommittee, as displayed in their Report, is certainlythe more melancholy of the two. It shows a deficiencyin the system of public instruction which oughtto be supplied at once. It is to be hoped that ourcivic fathers will forthwith establish a school for therudimental instruction of School-committeemen; andwe will engage to furnish it with competent teachersfrom the colored population of the city. If Normalschools are necessary for the instruction of teachers,how much more importan; is an institution for the instructionof those who select and superintend thepublic teachers! We trust this hint will not bethrownaway. One of the most alarming symptoms in the diagnosis of the Report of the majority, is the hungry aviditywith which it gobbles up its own propositions. Itis a case of mobid appetite—of preternatural voracity.It makes even Father Saturn seem a temperate feeder; he only devoured his children, while the Reportdevours itself. We remember to have read somewhere of a conjuror who promised, as the crowningattraction of his exhibition, that he would jump downhis own throat! We do not remember whether heperformed his feat, but the example of this Reportshows that such an act of self-deglutition was no impossibleboast. And certainly the public of Bostonwill evince a capacity of swallow which would havedone honor to the professor in question, if it cangulp down this Report under the impression that ithas philosophy, common sense, or common humanityto recommend it. diagnosis These schools are not maintained on the ground ofcomplexion! O, no! the distinction is one of racesnot of colors. If so, why not have separate schoolsfor the genuine Celtic Irish, who are as distinct arace from the Anglo-Saxons as the native Africans—much more so than the Africo-Americans—separatedfrom them by physical peculiarities almost as marked,and even by a distinct language? And, moreover, this class of our citizens 'live so compactly', (in the neighborhood of Broad-street,) that itwould not be generally inconvenient for them to attendspecial schools for their use. If the young Angle-Sa require to be guarded so dlously fromthe one , why suffer them to be exposed to thecontamination of the bther? If 'amalgamation isdegradation' in the first case, is it not equally so inthe last? We think the School Committee greatlyto blame in this matter. As a quence of thisdefect in our institutions, an Irish boy has just beenconducted by the public schools, to the episcopalThroe, of Boston. Had separate schools been maintainedfor the Irish race, on the same principle and inthe same spirit as the colored schools, bishop FitxPatrickmight now have been 'cuvating the genuinevirtues peculiar to that race, 'hewing wd, drawingwater, or digging ditches instend of cultivatingpolite letters and representing the vicegerent of God,and might at this moment have been wielding the hdistead of the crosier. complexion races          It seems that the separate schools were originallyestablished by the request of colored men. And thisfact is considered by the Committee as a conclusiveargument why no change should be made in the presentsystem. Because the men of the last generationasked, whether wisely or unwisely, for what seemedto them best in the then condition of the times andof public sentiment, are their children, to be foreclosedfrom asking for something elso which the alteredstate of public feeling and of the times demands?If it were competent for the colored men of the beginingof the nineteenth century to ask for separateschools for their children, is it not competent forthose of the middle of the century to ask for their abalition! The argument seems to as just as broad asit is long. We do not think our colored friends needbe in the least apprehensive of disturbing the shadesof 'Primes Hall, of Cyrus Vassal and of Prince' by making the demand they do—a demand, which we believe those worthy men would cordinallyconcur in, were they among us in the flesh,at the present time.  But we have not space of times for a review of allthe weak parts of this Report. And besides, it isdone to our hands in the mity Report. We needhardly to  the careful attention of our readers tothe entreats we have made, with a few running com-mentaries, from the Report of the majority, and tothe Report of the minority. They will amply repaythe times they will take up. The latter document inone which for style, sprint and reasoning, would dohoser to any mind is any community. It is certainlya credit to the common schools of New England,that they have sent forth a man capable of writing it.We earnestly hope that be will more frequently fa-vor the Anti-Slavery presses with the clear and ner-ous productions of his pen.   The Committee, in conclusion 'urge the coloredpeople and their friends to cease from these uselessassaults upon the separate schools, and to unite theirefforts with ours,' for their improvement. Reasonableas this request may appear, we grieve to say that wecan hold out to the Committee but faint hopes that itwill be complied with. We have had some personalacquaintance with the class of busybodies whohave disturbed the repose of the Committee —of'Joabs' whose 'heads have been to all this,' andwe are compelled to say that we have found themvery impracticable persons, and singularly indifferenceto all such tender entreaties. They have not qualifiedbefore the scowl of the exchange, they have resistedthe endearing allurements of the church, theyhave withstood the coarser cajoleries of the politicalparties, and we cannot flatter the School Committeewith the hope that they will listen any more consentinglyto their siren song, ' charm they never sowisely.' We apprehend that their view of the 'use-lessness' of their 'assaults' upon this system maydiffer from that entertained by the Committee. Theyhave been engaged in too many analogous contests,which seemed for a long time much more desperatethan this, and always with final success, to take thediscouraging view of their own prospects which seemto depress the spirits of the Committee. The growthof the minorities from years to year have been topromising to make it likely that they will desist froma prosecution of this claim. As one looking upon the committee with theeyes of 'a man and a brother,' and as one desirous ofprocuring for them that repose which is the desire ofall civic hearts, we would earnestly entreat them tosubmit to their fate at once, and yield the point with-out further struggle. Let them be lessoned by the famouscoon, who died with decency as sonn as he knewthat his antagonist was aptain Scott. For it is notone, but many, Captain Scotts, that the Committeehave to encounter. Let them not refuse to profit bythe example of those young ladies who are said tohave married their importunate suitors 'to be rid ofthem!' We fear that paece is not to be purchased oneasier terms. And though not a prophet, nor the oneof a prophet, we venture to predict, that if the peti-tioners have but patience and perserverance, they willat last prevail, like the window in the pariable, andmany a window since, 'because of their importanity.—'Q.
