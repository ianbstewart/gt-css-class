 ☞ 'Yes! it cannot be denied—the slaveholdinglords of the South prescribed, as a condition of theirassent to the Constitution, three special provisions tosecure the perpetuity of their dominion over theirslaves. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African slave trade; the second wasthe stipulation to surrender fugitive slaves—an engagementpositively prohibited by the laws of God,delivered from Sinai; and thirdly; the exaction, fatalto the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor slaves—for articles of merchandize, underthe name of persons.... Its reciprocal operationupon the government of the nation is, to establish anartificial majority in the slave representation over thatof the free people, in the American Congress, andthereby to make the PRESERVATION, PROPAGATIONAND PERPETUATION OF SLAVERY THE VITALAND ANIMATING SPIRIT OF THE NATIONALGOVERNMENT.—JOHN QUINECY ADAMS.
