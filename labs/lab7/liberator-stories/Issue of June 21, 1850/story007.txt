 We saw most of the New England Anti-SlaveryConvention, which was constantly thronged by angermultitudes who were addressed by able, eloquent,soul-stirring speakers. The agitation of the publicmind from centre to circumference throughout ourcountry calls out friend and too, and renders the Anti-Slaveryfor more than ever a burning focus oflight and bent. Indifferentists are aroused, are forced to take sides, friends are animated with unwontedseal, and enemies ere straitlaced to do theirworst The late riotous proceedings in New Yorkhave intended their contagion to Boston, wherenothing but impurity was wanting to bring forth alike shameless exhibition of the mocracy.    The Boston Herald, like its cousin, the New YorkHerald, did what it  to stir up the moral dregsto mischief. These delectable organs of Bhad their hirelings on the platform, scribbling scurrilityby the column It was a spectacle worth admiringto see with what  and conte idencethese half-slaves equil not there, compoundingslope of misrepresentation, caricature andfalsehood for the gullets that revel at their troughs. They looked as covey and self-possessedas if engaged in some h and decent employmentinstead of this low, mercenary blackguardism TheNew York Herald's hireling actually avowed, in ashort speech, that he was not ashamed of his agency.Quite likely he was not. Shame implies some remains,at least of self-respect, which we are slow tobelieve a fellow can feel who sells himself to muchmasters. It was remarkable what an affinity existedbetween the rowdies sprinkled ever the house andthese mustached b'oys. They instinctively sympathizedwith and understood such other. They delightedonly in what was extravagant, pepph oraboard, and if they lacked that ready cooked to theirtaste, they knew how to concoct enough of it by tionand caricature. As to what was serious, rational,candid and impressive to honest minds, it wasperfectly irk to them. They were not there toenjoy, or  to the nobler sentiments or qualitiesof humanity. They were only there to peek up or tomanufacture offal and carrion for the herd to whichthey eater.      equil    ashamed mustached     enjoy,  We wished, as we saw how thing were going on,that all the clapping, thumping and racket of the theatre,which has found its way into our philanthropiesmeetings, could be sent back to the pit whence itcame, together with all the  clip-clap, whichwhack phrases, squibs and witticisms which are adaptedto excite such a racket, and that the friends ofhumanity, with a deep and reverent earnestness,might appeal solely to the understandings, consciencesand hearts of honest, sober, well-disposedcommon people. These carrion b that newinfect our platform and assemblies would then disappt;and if monocracy should he let loose againstus, as even then it might be sometimes, its recoilupon itself would be instantaneously fetal to all itsinstigators. We should then know a rowdy or a mobocratat a single glance. We should than possess aholy covering of purely religious and philanthropicdignity, which would render police office unnecessary,or if Belial, and Bedlam should break forthupon us, and police officers should come to take theminto custody, they could readily distinguish themwhen making an uproar of pretended appliance. pit    We observed that there theatrical customs andtricks afforded a convenient introduction to the rowdyism,which, in spite of the city authorities, all butbroke up the Faneuil Hall meeting on Thursday evening.It was evident that the more vulgar of themob were under the generalship of their more refined,and that their policy was to bother and even toapplaud our meetings to deathâ€”taking due care notto commit any indictable breach of the public peace.In this game, the upper and lower cruet of our renownedAthena played successfully together at theFanil Hall meeting. That densely packed, immenseconcourse of people was filled with tumult andconfusion by a few hundred villains, many of themshamelessly respectable, summoned out by proclamationof the Boston Herald and doubtless countenancedby certain so-called 'retainers.' And did notthese same tricks, borrowed from the pits and galleriesof theaters, suberve their mischievous purposesnicely! We wish, but we can hardly hope, that ourdeclaratively moral power anti-slavery meetingsmight be placed under the protection of Christianreverence, calmness and dignity so that all theatricalnoise should be as much out of order as in the bestconducted religious assembly.   wish, hope, 'But,' says one, 'this would not do; our meetingswould then become intolerably dull and thin'. Wedo not believe it. Doubtless they would become dullto ists and blackguards. Doubtless they wouldbe themed of groundings and scorners. But is itcertain that solid, reverent and conons leversof God and humanity would not fill their places?There is talent, conscience, moral earnestness andChristian eloquence enough on and around the anti-slaveryplatform to inspire a  and unfalteringinterest in our asses. Who are to be relied uponto consummate the great humane and philanthropiesrevolution of public sentiment, which is to give thesemillion of slaves their freedom? Who else but menand women of real moral power? People may laughand giggle, and just, and  themselves with tomfooleryif they will, but this  and cruel devilof slavery is not to be cast out by such means. It isa kind of devil that gth not out, except by fastingand prayer; which presupposes moral dignity andintensely earnest ; and does not comport withhollow hearted theatrical uproar.          But the anti-slavery reform will take its own and whether directly by the right path, or roundand round through the wilderness, it will certainlyreach the goal in triumph. Individuals, classes andparties, hoy seeking the abolition of slavery,though sometimes working  with respectto such others convictions and , canscarcely work against the general cause itself. Chaslavery is so huge and great, an outrage againstall that is good in the universe, that the best plaschemes of its supporters cannot save it, nor theworst errors of  opponents greatly refer its overthrow.It is doomed. Its days are their completion.         The ma a Alike from friend and deadly As  and Of .
