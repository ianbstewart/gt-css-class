But another thought We had a mob the otherday in New York, in defense, of the Bible and theChurch, among other things. The  authorities,the police the press,  all more of less implicatedin it. How  it, that of all the meetings the anti-slavery meeting was singled out  up, and that slaveholders were on to this short trium of the wicked? And how it that we  on this anti-slavery in Boston—that the anti-slavery movement to be the movement round which all these  of  as ahind of  of the Bible andthe .                  The other day, in New York,  came up fromthe South and from the North from the from the West, gathering themselves together, the  clergy of the — a large repreof them— the make of their divinitywent up- the from Hon of afurnace. There was the American Bible Society,presented by Doctors of Divinity and Doctors ofLaw. There was the American Tract Society, and Ido not know what number of American MissionarySociion; the American Education Society, and theAmerican Colonization Society—of whom Slaverysays, when comparing it with these others, 'Manydaughters have done virtuously for me, but thou excellentthem all.' [Much laughter.] They were allgathered there. Slavery came up and joined its voice,and lent its influence, and thus the whole heaven overcast with those great rolling black cloudsof divinity, and of so-called philanthropy and Christianbenevolence. And you they were all perfectly,safe. There was no Capt. Rynders to disturb any ofthese. The city authorities did not voluntarily notthe mob upon them. Slavery had not looked terrifiedun anticipation of their gathering—had not looked forwardto it as to a time of tribulation. And when theSlave Power of the country saw this mighty force,gathered and leaning up like a thunder-storm againstthe Northern sky, it did not tremble, it did notshrink; for it was there with its representatives.And neither you nor I can tell how many negroes theweek before had been sold, that their pious mastersmight have the wherewithal to replenish the of the Lord on that, to them,  occasion. No,Slaver did not tremble. It looked on calm and ,Nay, more! It rejoiced; it thanked God andtook courage, and made Bennett's Herald and the N.Y. Globe its organs in giving  to its  ofthanksgiving.                   Let me ask some of this audience who lve manifesteddispleasure, how came it that slavery exhibitedno alarm and terror at all this array of so-calledchristian evolence? Was it not because it waswell aware that it had a magic wand, with which needed only to touch that clnd of divinity, and itcould conduct every bolt harmless to its feet?     But there was some came of terror there. In themidst of all that  and darkness, there wassome cause of terror. We did bob the  andwaves rolling. But why was it? For this that in the midst of all that aggregation of religiousand philpic power twinkng down from among'all those clouds and durk, there  one  star,   ray of light, as the star ofBethlehem. It was the  of  to the slaveholder,but the star of promise to the slave. It was to thetyrant more like that star of which you  in appvision, whose  was Worwood. It wasthis star which ting its plaing ray through thatcloud and that , dismay and through the ranks of the tyrants and their from the New York H upward or downward tothe  a of the South.                            It was the anti-slavery enterprise, that star, which sent more terror to the hearts of the rants,than the hand-writing upon the will sent inthe heart of the proud-king of Babylon.   I ask all in this audience, is there y thing hereinstructive! Is there any thing worthy  your consideration?You all agree, I suppose, with HenryClay, that slavery is a wrong; that it ought not toexist. How comes it, then, that so many are gatheredin defense of the Church that upholds it—gatheredin behalf of the popular religion and the enterpriseto which I have referred? How comes it thatall this compost of power is 'gathered' in this sametime in one blast of focal indignation upon this movement,while all others are spared? Have you thoughtof it? Have you considered in whose ranks you arefound? What has the anti-slavery movement do?What has it proposed to do? It compels no man tounite with it. It compels no man to look approvinglyupon it. It only asks what these other bodies and what the government concedes to them. It onlyasks a free field and fair discussion; and when youhave crushed it by argument, you have crushed itfor ever. But 1st me tell you, nothing less than thepower of truth—nothing less than the power ofthe omnipotent God is able to stay the rushing  ofhuman sympathy, that swells gloriously upward fromso many divine souls.    compels compels   Now, will ye fight against this movement! ye better beware, 'lost haply ye be found fightingagainst God.' Do you know say thing else so immortal asthe anti-slavery enterprise? Did n't ye  allyour energies twenty years ago against is? Did ye, like Herod of old, put every infant to the floor of Congress in the right of petition, that yemight destroy the child Jesus who had come to askfor the overthrow of slavery—the deliverance of thecaptive. Did not the Governor of this Common-wealth[Gov. Everest] recommend that the anti-slaverycause be visited with the artillery of penal ment?Did he not recommend to the Legislature toopen its batteries and  its laws against it? Didnot the country, North and South conspire againstit? Did you not raise earth and hell against the risingtide of humanity and human sympathy! Hasnot the mob been howling on its track from that dayto the present! Has not the Church and have notthe clergy visited it with their  anathemas, suming,like the anger of the Hebrew God, to thislowest hall! And yet what do you behold!         'Truth crushed to  will rise again.' Thiscause was never crushed. With all this terrible compostof opposition, this movement stands, and everhas stood, like a rock in mid , against which thebillows of centuries have  beating, but haveboston in vain. Now,  you learn ?Cannot the young men learn ? The anti-slaveryenterprise is a good  of you,and it has withstood  then you and bringagainst it. It was at one  embodied in theheart, I might almost say, of it  individual andYet the God of the oppressed held him in the of his hand, and its weapon  against  wassuffered to prosper. Young man! your it, but they found it too mighty for .                'Your fathers found the  should the children .     You had better stand . If it be of  itwill fall, and you will save your reputation in  of the public peace. But if it be of God, it be your wisdom and your prudence to at  retrfrom it and let it alone. It is out of the reach of yourartillery. Fire  it; flood cannot drownit; famine cannot  it; sword cannot destroy it.It is immortal in its own intrude ex, and no more die than God can die.            Now, then, had you not better let it alone, or, least, most it by fair argument? And than an excellent suggestion, I think, (If I have not forgottenthe little I ever did read in books,) an excellentsuggestion in Watt's Logic; and that is, 'in carryingon a discussion, unless you have the fullest in your own pew, the wiser way is to proceed byquestion rather then by declaration and open tion.'I think your great head in Massachusetts—Imean no less a person thin 'the godlike'—has givenyou a lesson in himself. I think you have seen himting up his past declaration, (O, what a repeat!)in such a way as to prevent you from pouring your own, so as to be obliged to devour the ment.          If you argue is men, palsied be the  and lentthe tongue which should not must you wiChristian courtesy and kindness. You see the of that kind of demonstration in New York. Therewas a missionary I read of the other day. He wantto Hindustan to convert the worshippers of Juggernaut;but he made a bad speculative, and finallymade a contract with the people to ran their our ofJuggernaut by steam. [Laughter, and cries of ',Shame!']      In New York the other day, the anti-slavery movementcame near receiving as powerful an  asthe car of Juggernaut had. We gained the of Capt. Rynders. We yoked that  to ourcar, and never had the chariot of anti-slavery such ateam before. [Prolonged applause.] If you wish todo this, to thus aid to, New York has set you a example: and I hope the  whoguided with  and bridle that at first able caravan will be able to guide you, so that whatyou mean for our harm, God shall mean it for ourgood, and the wrath of man shall thus praAnd what wrath does not praise him, God will restarts.
