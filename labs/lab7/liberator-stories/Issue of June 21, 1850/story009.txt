Now it is ElionCrafts, and men it is Henry Box Brown. Thisyour we have not any fugitive from slavery; but wehave the great Daniel himself a fugitive into slavery[A plaues and groans.] And in describing the manand his efforts, 1st it be remembered that we mean todescribe him graphically, if possible, as far as languagegive us the means—we mean pentingly to tell afterhim, and try to describe him truly; and if we fall, itshall be the fruit of the language, and not ours, If, ayear age, any sensitive person thought our languageharsh, most of this class will allow that the events ofthe last twelvemonth have rendered it . Our imaginationlegs wofully bobbed the Anglo-Saxon en-purityfor sinning, when once it goes fairly launchedin the theological or political ministres. Trulydoes Pope sing.                                  Pope 'Feign what you will, and  it are so strong.Some rising genius sins up to your song.'   Allow me one word more no to another questionthat was spoken to by my friend. He thinks it avery easy thing to talk against slavery, and that itwas an easy thing for Daniel O'Connell to do so. Letus judge of men by their times. Daniel O'Connellstood in the midst of the British people the championof eight millions of Irishmen. He knew their rights,He knew that they had been most tably, wickedlyand atrociously denied them for a long series ofyears. He went up to the House of Commons as theirchampion. He had behind him the great Irish Party,as Daniel Webster has behind him the great WhigParty of the North. And when the slave questioncrossed him path, did he bow his head? Did he trimhis sails to the British breeze? In order to securepersonal salvation, or the triumph of his own peculiar, was he ever silent when he ought to speak,was he ever about when he ought to act? No!Sir Thomas Boston has said that just after he hadstood all but alone in the House of Commons, andbeen obliged to agree with Lushington, that when hespoke in behalf of the slave, Lushington should applaud;in the year 1828, the moment Daniel O'Connellentered the door of the House, he stood at their side,proclaiming that Ireland should wait till doomsday,before he would absent himself from an anti-slaverymeeting in Exeter Hall, or from a division in theHouse of Commons, whenever his voice or vote wasneeded. It is now considered an easy thing to opposechattel slavery; and some think, yes, the pulpittell us, it is an easy thing to make speeches in theMelodeon and in Faneuil Hall in that behalf; thatthere is nothing of unpopularity or of sacrifice in itLet me ask such an one to come and take his sharewith us and try. To see the best yours of life wearaway in the advocacy of principles, which, except tothe eye of faith, are hopeless; and in reply to the tauntof 'fanatic' and 'mischief-maker,' to be able topoint to no stop of palpable progress thought wonwith so much tail, for which the malice and systematicmisrepresentation of the press have not prepared thepublic to answer, 'Ay! and but for you, we shouldhave had it ten years earlier, and ten times more perfect';to stand seeing, in others' behalf, for a hearing,and be scornfully refused by those, who, but for youropinions, would gladly have aspired to loose thelatchet of your shoo; to be so hated that the weakestpress may pervert your sentiments, and lead you withopinions you never uttered or held, and yet safelydy a line of correction; and thus to go thought theworld, utterly misunderstood by those in whose goodthought it is no weakness to wish to live; to seethose who sprung with you into the arena reap lanreisand win confidence, which, if honest effort, uncompromisingspeech, and readiness for every toil, beany, claim, you have equally deserved; to be so distrustedonly for opinion's sake, that you dwell onalien in the land of your birth, as much cut off fromsympathy or professional progress as an Irish Catholicin the days of William III.; to risk bankruptcyin obeying commands which the pulpit preaches ad, and them  you for practicing; in wishingto help any good, and not unpopular cones, to feelthat the best way you can do it is to give unseen, andnet load it or its friends with the heavy burden ofyour friendship; to be 'branded as an outlaw, stigmatizedas a traitor, all encouraged to vilify, degradeand insult you; chic, is seems, is the primrose pathof dalli, a bad of ! If you sepire to a tasteof real martyrdom, get cushioned in a fashionable pulple,and an order your speech that all men may speakwall of you, and that is self-denial! That is takingup the cross and bens it. But as for the other,how easy is it! since now it  clear of the and runs no risk of the jail!   stood at their side,         Let me ask such an objector to to assemble his fellow-citizensin this manner in this or any other hall, andthem let him look about after he has made an or an honest effort in behalf of a noble principle andmost unfortunate —three million of  robbedand spoiled,  and pealed, meted outand tradden down, Let him one that the very reportersthat alt behind, while they have a respectfulword for every other meeting that take place in thisday, never till the colume of the daily press withsay thing else them caricatures of the conduct andbearing of an anti-slavery assembly. Why is it that nodaily press in New England, no daily press either inNew York or Boston, undertakes to report us withthe rtity, but always interiords its sketchof our meetings with abuse, in order to make it palatable?I appeal to meet if not all of the newspapers inthis city in support if this representation. For 'Fray, and Swerth' all bark at us.        Mr. May—I wish to state one fact conserning oneof the reporters not have present. And I do not meanthat the sentiment he expressed is that of all of them,bur it is that of some. After the resolutions had beenreported yesterday from the bush committee, oneof the reporters who not have asked to look at one ofthem, and I honded him the whole series. He told he did not want the first of them. I informedhim that we considered is important to get before thepublish the opinions of O'Connsil, , Wenley and Albert Bar. 'Why,' sold he, 'weonly went the justen.' I inquired for what paper hereported. And he would not at first reply! but aftersome time he said he was reposting for the New York. Afterwards, I understood that won not the.        A Reporter—He did import for the Hereld. Mr. May—It is now said that he is a reporter forthat paper. Mr. Phillips—Thought the man is either above or belowhumanity who is utterly regardless of the opinionsof good men, still I do not state as any thing thataggravated , or about which we are particularly solicitous;but ' show which way the windblown,' and we wish to estimate aright the publicopinion about me, The littlest  is of importunceto us, just as Daniel Webster's speech is of importanceto us. What we want to got at is the feeling of thepolitical, religious and neutral papers toward our, and we sweap up every thing that enables usto judge of this tly.      New, Mr. Webster contends, and other men you are told in the periodicals and publish of thiscity, that the anti-slavery enterprise is a uni. Islave have an extract from a letter of Webster, justpublishing, to the Newburyport Commotion. Mr. Websterque a letter from a distinguished friend, who that he does not doubt that the anti-slavery enterprisefrom its , has done evil, and nothingbut evil, continually. [Applause in the gallorios.]New, we are told if we would only be still, about our from the publis eye in relation to this subjectis some where, I know not where, a great body ofanti-slavery feeling that would some forward and tothe work. What  in there of it? What eviis there that there is any such anti-slavery senmentsany where? In what corner of that community,in which the pulpit preaches abuse of Garrison,and the pr enters with caricatures of allanti-slavery meetings, before which relu statdisgrace themselves, (for, however our Marshfieldfriend may offer to hunt slaves 'with cherity,'common charity bids us suppose, for the honor of humannature, that these and spouches are  forth,) in what corner of that communityslaps the anti-slavery thunderbolt which neitherpriest nor politician dare touch for four of being kenfor Garrison, or his follower! Here, as where, , the think, the great law of supply anddemand. As Scott makes Doughs will the ScottishQueen, of her pony.                 'May wanted , and  is '    so when the communally really has on anti-slaverywish, when anti-slavery leading articles are wanteddepend upon it, the Respectable Dally will furnishthem; and when the hand touches 11 on the anti-slaverydial, the Websters and Winthrops will maketheir great anti-slavery speeches—and them we willbreak our w, out occupation . These are chemical-. Would you find the place of the risingsun? Trouble not yourself about parallels andmeridians; see to what quarter the stateman 'crooksthe pregnant hinges of his knee'—some so wise ashe in the matter of feeling the publish pulse. 'Asface answers to face in the water,' so, in nine of , answer the Washington types to Bostonfeeling. We will believe in this concealed virtue,this shrinking anti-slavery conscience, on sensitivethat, for from letting its eight hand knew what itsleft hand does, it will not let either hand do anything—when trimmer Winthrop di it! True,he is no wanted        'Lous watcher on that  height;—  but surly His shining forehead (will be font) With that inspiring prophecy.'   Here is Webster's Letter. A Voice—Read it. Mr. Phillips—O, I could not read the whole of it.'Religion,' says this distinguished friend from whomhe quotes, 'is an excellent thing in every matterexcept polities.' [Laughter.] I am glad to learn that.Politics, them, is no concern of the ministers, becausethere is no religion in it. 'There' (in polities) it seemsto make men mad.' For instance, Webster? 'And Ido not know of any people more mad than the anti-slaverypeople on your side of the water and onours' (Much mirth.) 'Up to the present tome, I haveno doubt that they have aggravated every evil theyhave endeavored to mitigate or prevent. If you tailone of them what has been the result of his officiousness,he answers, "Liberavi animam meam." I mayhave done wrong, but I shall go to heaven for it. SoI believe that your abolitionists have made the state ofthe slave, and still more that of the free black, muchworse than it would have been; and probably inmany States, that of Virginia for instances, have retardedhis enfranchisement, But they care little, ifthey save their own souls.' Liberavi animam meam. In those sentences,' says Webster, 'my friendmeans undoubtedly to ascribe the evils which he sotruly states, (one of the evils being that religion hasget into politics,) not to true and genuine religion,not to the religion of the Gospel, but to that fantasticalnotion of religion which sometimes pomen's imaginations.' Now, I will tell you what thatfantastical religion is. It is the notion that there issomething of higher obligation is morals then theConstitution of the United States!  Mr. Webster throws quite a thunderbolt at HorsesMann. He says, 'If what Mr. Mann says of the provisionsof the Constitution in this publication be a testof his accuracy in the understanding of that instrument,he would do well not to seek to protect hispeculiar notions under its sanction, but to appeal atonce, as others do, to that higher authority which sitsenthroned above the Constitution and above the law.'He goes on to ridicule the idea that there is any thingabove the Constitution or above the law. And themhe describes the abolitionists. Now let me read to you the description that hegives of this meeting. And what is our sin? Why,I will tell you what it is that has brought upon us thisthunderbolt from the godlike of Massachusetts. Wehave said that it is as wrong to return Ellen Crafts toGeongis, as it would be for the Sultan of Turkey toreturn Koseuth back to Hungary; that if DanielWebster could get rid of prejudice, he would see thatthe principle he so eloquently urged for the Hungariansis perfectly applicable to the fugitive slave inMassachusetts. Our heresy consists in this; that wehave exhorted George N. Briggs to gird up his loinsand endeavor to obtain that moral salvation which theSultan of Turkey has reached in the presence of thecivilised world; and we have exberted the Governor,if; he cannot new see the Sultun, to get the use of amoral telessepe, larger than that at Cambridge, andtry if he cannot, with this enormous power of telescopesvision, get a sight of the Mahomotan polygamistof Constantinople, for up in the clear heaven, to 'bewray him that wanderoth, 'as MassachusettsGovernment, down in this Slough of Despond,swear to do.  That is all we have said. We have declared thatone created in God's image has aright to his ownbody, and his own wife, and his own children, andthat a man is a traitor to God and himself alike, who,in obedience to any parchment, however old or useful,shall lay his hand on a fugitive, and aid his masterin getting him beak. Is that blasphemous? Is itany thing that ought to be called fanatical? Wholongs for an opportunity of aiding in a slave hunt?The abolitionists, as for as this letter speaks, are arraignedas refusing to return fugitive slaves, Mr. Webtorsays that the Constitution orders it. So saywe, that the Constitution orders it; and that is thereason we hate the Constitution. He says he meansto do it; and we mean to record that pledge, black,upon the page of history, and make his biographerrecord it to his shame, whenever his grave closes overhim. (Hour, hear,), He has the Whig party and MosesStuart on, his side; but there is a grave beforehim, into which he is to . And then, when theglare of high position is gone, when the excitement ofparty feeling in over, before the still, calm bar of posterity,his pledge and our denunciation of it shall bothstand. 'God grant him a good deliverance. 'It isvain, perhaps, now to hope that any voil which Veniceover hung over the futures of her coward Doges, orany make of scorn which history leaves on the of Stanford or Arnold, will weigh, in the hot momentof temptation, against the banblon of expected offer;but, at any rate, Lib animas , and thatis something. Let posterity judge whether our tion,that any man's citation of the Constitution as for moral tupitude is , and that the of slavers is , be sound reason or ill-temparedabuse. We are content to wait the verdict.   Lib animas ,        Harvard Collage  trampled on Dr. Follen forhis anti-slavery principles, and in their pride of pleaseand power, they did it successfully. They trampledhim under their feet. But when his life was written,ten years later, how anxiously did the Collage attemptto explain away the ugly that. They failedThat were placed at the bar of a correct public opinionwhich this single instance of Dr. Follen had doneso much to  and that opinion was give againstthem.   Mr. Webster  now in the Senate of the UnitedStates girt about with 987 unhappy retainers ofBoston. He may  firm; yet there is a publicopinion, and that we shall , or create. And, offerall, as James Madison says, the heart is the best on a question like this.' We appeal to inthese and brothers, we appeal to common men, thatare not equal to his legis. Against these . instincts of our , it in nothing that a grotparty is prostate beneath the away of his sophistry;it is nothing that his tbory has broken the lawshope of political resistance to the Slave Power at ; it is nothing that personal , hope of of being , the prestige of a great have swept away the little rem of Northernresistance. He known well, none butter, for it ishis own language. 'There is an  that still to shock the glory of these triumples. It followsthe conqueror back to the very seems of his evations;it calls upon him to sake notice that the nation,though silent, is yet indignant; it  him that the of his victory is a harron ; that it shallco neither joy nor , but shall mouldet todry asked in his grasp. In the  of his exultation,it  his on with the cry of injured justice;it denounors against him the indignation of in onlightenedand civilized age; it turns to  theway of his rejecting,  him with the stingwhich belongs to the com if having the apin of mankind.                               Let me read you his beautiful description if ourselves—no abuse, of course. Mr. Webster does not usethe Angle-Suzan language. Let us sea what he says.'New England, it is well known, is the chosen sentof the abolition process and the abolition societies.Here it is principally that the former cheer the morningby full columns of lamentations over the fate ofhuman beings free by a law above the Constitution,but sent ; slavery and stripes.'   Now, mark you, it is the anti-slavery process that'cheer the morning by fall columns of over the fate of human beings free by nature, 'but sentback to 'slavery and stripes.' Mr. Daniel Websterhas no lamentations for it! He does not charge theWhig press with the high crime of  forsuch a trife! The religions press in not guilty of it.It is New England, poor, miserable land, that holdsin its besom these foul anti-slavery p with inmentationsfor these 'free by nature, and by a lawabove the Constitution,' but sent back to 'slaveryand stripes.' This, Daniel Webster has no lamentationsfor. No! Moses Stuart in writing new that Paulsent back Onesimus; Moses, Daniel and Paul(Laughter.) Moses Smart is writing that 'Deuteronomydoes not forbid it, for it only says, 'thou shaltnot return the servant that has occuped, 'meaningthou shale not retune him to the .' And thenhe says, 'We do not return the slave to a heathenmaster when we send him to South Caroline; but wereturn him to a Christian.' As for this professedcommentator, 'with one foot in the grave, 'as he himselftells us, is he against the return of the fugitiveslave? O, no! it is only against returning them to theheathen. Then shalt not muscle the or that treadethout the corn,' said Paul. And then he sake,'Doth God take care for oxen No!' He gave onto say, It is the truth which lies beneath this' whichis intended. And so, if there should come anotherPaul, would he not venture to ask Mr. Stuart, canyou thing beneath the bark and the rind ofthat tent of Douterousay which soculls another—'Then shalt love thy brother as thyself,' and underwhich it is equally guilty to return the slave to himwho is called Christian as to any other oppressor?      Mr. Webster adds, 'The latter,' that to, the abolitionsocieties, 'refresh themselves from daily sell by orgiesof the night devoted to the same outpourings of philanthropy,mingling all the while their anatheman atwhat they call "man-catching" with the most horridand profane objurgations of the Christian Sabbath,and indeed of the whole Divine Revelation.' Yes,we call it 'man-stealing.' He names it, 'return offugitives from labor'! Innocent phraseology! 'Theysanctify their philanthropy by religions profanity;they manifest their charity by contempt of God hadhis commandments.' Query: what is the commandmentof God? The second section of the fourth articleof the United States Constitution, is that a commandmentof God! or is, 'Then shalt love thyneighbor as thyself' the commandment of God whichstands nearest to this subject! Who manifest theircontempt for God? The men who say there is a lawabove the Constitution, or the man that in this letter,throughout the whole of it, denion it, deems it fanaticism,and ridicules Seward for affirming, with'what he thinks eloquence,' that there is a role bindingupon us above the Constitution! This Daniel Webster is but a part of a man. Godcreated me, I humbly believe, but the Constitutioncreated him (applause and hisses): been one everyman looks up to his Creator for his highest law, andif Mr. Webster knows nothing of any higher law thanthe Constitution; if, when he fixes those great, dark,eloquent eyes of his on the blue vault of heaven, hesees nothing higher then that parchment of 1787, thenhe is the creature of the parchment of 1787, and notof the Lord God Almighty, whose will be refuses toobey. Why, one would imagine according to this latterthat we were to imitate the Ephesians; that everyAmerican child was to cry out, 'Great is the Constitutionof the United status,' 'which fell down fromJupiter,' and that were the Alp and Om of hisfaith. Alp  Om  I did not intend to speak as long as I have on thissubject. It had been determined that the subject ofour plan for the coming your should be taken up fordiscussion, and also the collection of funds for thefurtherance of it. I hope some of those who followme will speak to this point It seems to me thatthe present is one of the must favorable times foranti-slavery discussion. We have thrown the subjectbefore the community. Mr. Webster says, atthe end of this very later, that Congress is nowsix or eight months old, and there seems to be noprospect of an and to the discussion. 'I hardlydare expect,' he says, 'any progress in useful legislationuntil a spirit shall prevail, both in Congress andthe country, which shall look more to things importantand real, and less to things ideal and abstract.' Thisidea of slavery is only a trifle! Robbing a man ofhis wife and children is an abstraction! What wewant is a tariff, a United States Bank, Ministers toEngland, Secretaries of State, Overseers of the NavyDepartment. These are 'important and real.' Libertypf speech, turning Massachusetts into a hunting]ground for fugitive slaves, these are not 'real' andnot 'important'—they are 'ideal and abstract.' Let us see how profound his study of anti-slaveryhistory has been. Mr. Webster says that 'No seisureof an alleged fugitive slave has ever been made inMains.' Now, I can tell him that a Maine  landedwith fugitive slaves in Both. They were disseveredand arrested, and if the Governor of the State of Minehad been a Constitutional man, merely, a Webster man,he would have returned them to slavery, but he declined.He made all sorts of legal objections, to such anextent that the thing was given up, and the men remainedin Mains. He says, No seizure of an allegedfugitive slave has ever been made in New Hampshire.'That may be true; but George Washington himself,if the traditions of the town of Strafford are true, attemptedto get information from New Hampshireabout a fugitive from Maunt Vermont, and as that timeWashington frilled. 'No seizure of an alleged fugitiveslave has ever been made in Vermont, and the casewas tried before Judge Harrington, in 1987. Weknow what the answer of the old judge was. Whenasked what evidence of  would satisfy —'I want a bill of sale from God Almighty; (applauses.) That was an actual case, and JudgeHarrington; was a Judge of the Supreme Court ofVermont; and the decision to one which may be quotedas authority to the G boys at .  Constitutional man, merely,       Mr. Webster says, 'No seizure of an  fugitiveslave it known to have been make the ,enough one shout twenty-five years ago I that is a mistake. If I  rightly, very after that disgraceful  against the school of MissCrandall was a case which  a subject ofmuch comment; but C not to herself in pursuing it.          Some instances of the seizure of alleged fugitiveslaves are known to have occurred in this in Massachusetts.' You don't say it  exceptone, took place in Boston, twelve or fifteen years ago.'It is the Letimer case which he has remembered, and'he has placed it  'twelve or fifteen years ago.'O! 'The Northern side of his memory,' as HenryWard Bencher says, 'is surely per.' He forgetswhat John H.  did, who new owns that hehas 'returned to a sense of his constitutional duty.'Surely, he was in his constitutional duty,  itwith slaty.' When, in South  without a warrant,he seized a fugitive slave, and sent him back inone of his  vessels without lodge or jury, Mr.Webster might have inquired of him, and he wouldhave  something more re even than the , which occurred seven or eight years ago!and if they have been less  than men suppose,why is it? There are hundreds of fugitive slaves inBoston at this moment. Why do they not come andget them? He represents the voles of .denial Webster dwells have with these sentimentsin his heart, and nobody retakes him. He is theSenator of the State. There are hundreds of fugitive within the  of his voice when in BostonWhy do not the slaveholders come and get them?They are not prevented because of Webster's letters!no because of any of his speeches! No  But it is there have been certain mice graving thenote which hold the  of these men, whoonce kno to such stat as Henry Clay. Thesefew humble individuals have dragged the Commonwealthback to her old 'prejudices' against theslave-hunt. Heaven grant she may ves get rid ofthem! 'Get rid of this prejudies,' said David Humeto the Christian mother. 'My son, can you show meany thing better?' was her reply.
