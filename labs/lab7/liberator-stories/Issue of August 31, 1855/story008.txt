 Mr. EDITOR—I wish to present to the public,through the solemn of the , a plain statementof an affair which identity took place inCass Co., Mo. In the providence of God, and thearrangement of the Methodist Episcopate Church,I was called to preach the Gospel in Case Co., Mo.,in the Harrisonville circuit. I endeavored to dischargemy duty, as a Christian minister, to thebest of my ability, teaching nothing but thesetruth which make wise unto expiation, and havingnothing to do with the voting questions of theday. I had labored them on the above circuit for aperiod of  months, and up to about threeweeks ago, the blessing of God attending my labors,and nothing concerning in mar the peace andharmony between me and my people. About thetime named, an article appeared in the C Ce.Gazette, written by one John A. Toggle, a memberof the M.E. Church, South, in which thosewas an attempt to excite public opposition againstme, by alleging that I had said certain things tohim, in a, private conversation, respecting the decisionof the question of slavery or no slavery inKansas, and seyling me a Northern abolitionist.About a week after the appearance of this article,two negroes attempted to escape from Harrisonville,and a report was immediately circulatedthat I, together with other residents of the townand country, had instigated them to make the attempt—than which nothing could be more false,as I had not even once spoken to a single negrowhile president in Case country; and the other personswere above suspicion, one of whom had beena resident in the State forty-seven years. DITOR     private conversation forty-seven years. On Thursday morning, July 26th, while peaceablypursuing my way along the public road, Iwas overtaken by two men—one of them known toCol. Worley—who addressed no some impendentquestions as to where I was going, &C, and finallyinformed me that I had been accused of incitingslaves to escape, and of preaching abolition doctrine,and that I must return with him to Hurrisonville,and have the charges investigate. Thisconversation they interlarded with the most profaneoaths that could fall from mortal lips. I protestedagainst their right thus to stop me on thepublic highway, when the d Ol. W.leaped from his horse, and began fumbling abouthis person, as if feeling for a pistol. After somefurther purely, I informed them that, inasmuch as Iwas entirely innocent of the charges alleged, and didnot fear a fair investigation, I would accompanythem to Harrisonville for that purpose. Just aswe turned to go back, sixteen more men, mounted,made their appearance. We stopped at a cabin inthe prairie fro supper, where the bottle was freelypassed, and I received the most issuing treatment,being asked to drink, and made the subject of objests and horrid oaths.    We reached Harrisonville about 12 o'clock atnight, and I was taken to a hotel, and a guard ofthree men placed over me during the night, as if Ihad been the greatest criminal. Next morning, Iwas waited upon by three men, who informed methat they were a committee to search my effects,in order to ascertain if I had any abolition documents.This committee was composed of a Rev.Mr. Allen, Baptist preacher, Mr. Bailey, and theproprietor of the hotel where I was confined.They searched everything I had, examined myBible and hymn book, and read my private letterscarefully; but could find nothing to substantiatetheir charges. While this examination was inprogress, a meeting was called at the Court House,and I could hear some person delivering whatseemed to be a very inflammatory speech. After awhile, a committee, composed of a Dr. Hbraugh,Col. Worley, and Rev. Mr. Allen, came toinform me that I was wanted at the Court House.I accompanied them, and found about two hundredmen, most of whom were of a low class, for I willdo that community the justice to say, that very fewrespectable persons participated in these outrages.A certain Dr. Ml sat as chairman of the meeting.After a call to order, Dr. Hansbgh raceand said that I had been accused of aiding somenegroes in running off, and had been preaching abolitiondoctrines and circulating abolition documents,and that it had been received, as thesense of that meeting; that I should have the Statein seven days. Baptist preacher private letters    I replied briefly, that I protested against theirentire proceedings: that with a fair investigation,I could prove all their charges false, and challengedthem to such investigation; that if I had doneanything contrary to law, I held myself bleto it, and was witting is suffer its p tothe full. I was told by one of the f in thematter, that the law was out strict enough, andthey intended to take it in their own hands, and thatif I did not leave, the consequences would be uponmy own head.    take it in their own hands This, Sir, is but a brief statement of the norin which I have been treated on American soil,by persons calling themselves American citizens.How long  things are to continue, I cannottell, but I think it is high time that something wasdone to put a stop to them. The fair fame of Missouriis thus disgraced by  of —Forcertainty men thus acting can be termed nothingelse, and, as yet, no effort has been made by theofficers of the law, or the Executive of the State,to relieve her from the stain. What a contrast dosuch proceedings form to the g of our institutionsand the spirit of '70! Our a land of liberty, if  a state of affairs is allowedbe continues! I, Sir, am a Southern manby birth, and came  from a Southern city, butif Southern institutions are to be protested by suchmen as mareated me, I think I shall took spot where, at , my dearest rights shall befree from . Let the citizens ofMissouri think ly upon the cewhich I  todescribe-one  of several similar  whichhave recently —and let them  whatthey will do: whether they will be  ever them  anylonger,  and bring contemptupon themselves and their children.                        Hoping that wise and  may obtain.  I am, &C W.H. WILLEY. St. Louis, August .
