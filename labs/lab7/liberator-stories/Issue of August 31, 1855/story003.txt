 The famous leader of the Cuban Fillibusters hashas nominated for Congress by the DemocraticCommittee of the Vth District of Mississippi.The convention met at Monticello on the 23rdJuly, and after considering the names of severalmedicates, selected John A. Quitman by acclamation.In the course of the proceedings, a letterwas read from this military filibuster, from whichto make the following audacious extracts:â€” As to my own personal inclinations, I am not selicitousof a nomination for Congress, and at anytime when the danger to Southern Rights and Institutionswas less imminent, I would decline it;but I feel that when the enemies of our domesticInstitutions are marshaling their forces for a deadlyassault upon us, no Southern man has a rightto decline any post of duty to which the publicvoice may assign him. I believe that the institution of negro slavery isnot only right and proper, but the natural andnormal condition of the superior and inferiorraces, when in contact. That as the chief elementof our country's prosperity, it constitutes agreat interest, which is entitled, like other greatinterests, to the fostering ears and protectionof the Federal Government, within the sphere ofits powers. That legislation or action directly orindirectly hostile to this interest is at war withour compact of Union, and should be resisted bythe States and the people affected by it at allhazards. That the preservation of the institution ofSlavery in Cuba, which can be only affected byher independence and separation from the maligninfluence of European Governments, is essentialto the safety and preservation of our own system.That our Government ought not to thwart, butrather encourage by all proper means the diffusionof American Republican institutions on this continent.That it is consistent with the designs ofProvidence, and our rights and duty, not to restrainbut to encourage the Caucasian white race to carryhumanity, civilization and progress to the rich andfertile countries south of we, which now in the occupationsof inferior and mixed races, lie undevelopedand useless, furnishing only a theatre ofoperation for British intrigue to annoy us. Thatthe policy of our Government in regard to thesemomentous questions has been too much influencedby the prevalent spirit of hostility to negroslavery, and the determination not to permit itsextension. That upon all matters connected withour peculiar domestic institutions, the South mustlook to herself. That no national party organizationwill fully protect us.
