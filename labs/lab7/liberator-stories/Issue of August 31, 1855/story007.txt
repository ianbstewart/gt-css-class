 ☞The following extract is taken from a letterof Hon. Daniel S. Dickinson, of New York, firstpublished in the Tallahasee Floridian and Journal,of August 4, but written in June, 1855:— Floridian and Journal 'Whether I am in favor of their platform uponthe question of domestic slavery most depend uponwhat it is; or rather, whether they are in flavor ofmine. If their platform is to be regarded as includingupholding or justifying such politicalmonstrosities as the "personal theory bill," pecentlypassed into a law by the Massachusetts Legislatureover the vote of Governor Gardiner, thenI pronounce it treason of the deepest dye—treason, rank, unblusing and condign punishment.If upon this subject their platform conformsto resolutions recently published, purportingto be the voice of a majority of the conventionassembled at Philadelphia, it is in substance thesame upon which I have stood for years— uponwhich I did not enter without counting the consequences,and which I intend to relinguish onlywith life.' justifying The miserable caitiff!
