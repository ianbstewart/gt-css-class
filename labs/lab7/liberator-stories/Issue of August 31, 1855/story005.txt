 The New York Times may  at Dr. Van Euriefur assuming, to prove that the negro is not awhite man, and pretend that no one believes thathe is; nevertheless, the whole political doctrinesof the Times are founded on the presumption thatthe negro, in everything but the color of his skin,is a white man. The abolitionists have assortedit over and over again, and the Times and its partyhave always represented to their readers andthe public at large, that the negro is held in slaverybecause of the color of his skin. 'He is thesame as you, endowed with the same inalienablerights,' says the Times, 'and the South oppresshim simply because he is black.' New York Times  Times Times Times Doctor Van ive proves that the negro is notthe same as the white man, or Caucasian, in anyrespect, and that the color of his skin has nothingto do with his position. If he was white as snow,and possessed the same other marks of distinctionand inferiority, he would be held in servitude. Heis not only not a white man, but he is not enoughlike a white man to amalgamate with him, or overhe raised to an equality with him, and, therefore,his present position as a servant of the Caucasian,is the very best he has ever found: and when thepeople are brought to look upon the negro as he is,and ever has been, and to know how he is treatedin different countries, and what has been the effectupon him of the various treatments, they will besatisfied that the Southern people have and aredoing the best by him of any people in the world.It is the object of Dr. Van Errie to show all thefacts, and he is doing it in a most masterly manner.â€”New York Day Book.  not New York Day Book.
