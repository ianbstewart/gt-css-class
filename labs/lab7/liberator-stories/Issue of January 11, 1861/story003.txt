 The Hon. George Ashmun, of Springfield, Mass.,who presided over the convention that nominatedMr. Lincoln for the Presidency, has written a letterto Hon. R.C. Winthrop, in which he uses the followinglanguage:â€” * * * "I say, then, without hesitation, that inmy judgment the enactments of our Legislature,which are intended or calculated to impair the forceand effect of the fugitive slave arts of Congress, are,wholly unconstitutional and void. They shouldnever have been passed, and ought not to be permittedto remain on our statute book. I denouncesthem when they were first projected, and have neverfailed to feel and express a deep regret that any ofour people should have been led, by acts of injusticeson the part of any of our sister States, to retaliateby an act of indefensible wrong on our own part."* * * ""Let us, incoming before the august tribunalof public opinion, an asking for the best judgmentof the civilized world and of posterity, stripourselves of every impediment which may embarrassus in the conflict. Let Massachusetts stand erect,conscious not only of the righteousness of her cause,but of her fitness for its advocacy."
