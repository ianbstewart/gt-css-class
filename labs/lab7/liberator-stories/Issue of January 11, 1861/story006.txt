 Yankee Doodle took a saw,With patriot devotion,To trim the Tree of Liberty,According to his "notion!"    Yankee Doodle on a limb,Like another noodle,Cut between the tree and him,And down came Yankee Doodle!   between the tree and him,And down came Yankee Doodle!  Yankee Doodle broke his neck,Every bone about him,And then the Tree of LibertyDid very well without him!    â€”New York Journal of Commerce. S.D. New York Journal of Commerce.
