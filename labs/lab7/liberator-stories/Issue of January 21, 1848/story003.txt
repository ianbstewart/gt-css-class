 MR. GARRISON: R. ARRISON I wish to know whether a man can be a consistentDissolution, who, after he has signed the positionfor a Dissolution of the Union, goes to thepolls and votes? There seems to be a difference ofopinion on this point; for I am confident that out ofthe great number of petitioners from Leominster andAbington, last year, not one quarter carry out theirprofessions by staying away from the polls. Itseems to me that, after we have signed the petition,we have dissolved the Union, as far as we are concerned,and therefore have no right to vote after shutâ€”exceptit be the Disunion ticket. I, nevertheless,present to all I see; but I do it more to draw theirattention to the question, than with the expectation ofsecuring their names. The reason of my bringingup this question now is, because there are some whohave asked me, when I have presented the petitionto them, whether they should have to deny themselvesthe privilege of voting, after singing it? ihave always told them frankly, YES. For I do notwish to go to the Legislature in company with thosewho I think will 'eat their own words' at the nextelection, by voing for those who will trample our petitionin the dust. The State House has been longenough disgraced by empty professions and rottenresolutions, without abolitionists adding to it bysending in the names of those for a Dissolution ofthe Union, who we know will vote next town meetingday to sustain the Union. I hope, if all wrongon this question, you will point out the error; for,taking the other view of it, I think there is a possibilityof obtaining many more than we now have. ES. Yours for practical Dissolution,J.H. CRNE.
