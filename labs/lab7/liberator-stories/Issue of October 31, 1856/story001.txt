 ☞'Yes! IT CANNOT BE DENIED—the slaveholdlords of the South prescribed, as a condition of theiraent to the Constitution, three special provisions TO THE PERPETUITY OF TRUTH  OVER THEIRSLAVES. The first was the immunity, for twenty years,of preserving the African slave trade; the second wasTHE STIPULATION TO SURRENDER FUGITIVE SLAVES—anengagement positively prohibited by the laws of God,delivered from inal; and, thirdly, the exaction, fatalto the principles of popular representation, of a representationfor SLAVES—for articles of merchandise, underthe name of persons ..... in fact, the oppressor representingthe oppressed... To call government thus constituteda democracy, is to insult the understanding ofmankind. It is doubly tainted with the infection ofriches and slavery. Its reciprocal operation upon thegovernment of the nation is to establish an artificialmajority in the slave representation over that of thefree people, in the American Congress; AND ERESTTO MAKE THE PRESERVATION, PROPAGATION AND PERPETUATIONOF SLAVERY THE VITAL AND ANIMATED SPIRITOF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.'—John Quincy Adams.
