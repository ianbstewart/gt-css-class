 RESTORATION OF THE UNION. We hare lookedconfidently to a restoration of the Union, of thewhole Union, and of nothing leas than the Union;but because the sentiments of the Northern disorganizerswere flatly repudiated by the sterlingpatriotism and good sense of the people, and by theGovernment. When the President rebuked Fremontand dismissed Cameron; when the Cabinetand the Congress vowed that toe ante object of toewar was to maintain the national authority; whenthe glorious Generals, Burnside, Buell, Hallock andMcClellan, carried out this on the field; when rebellion'screst fell in Missouri and in Kentucky, thenthe work on civil and military fields seemed to gograndly on. Let honest men renew their purposeto keep faith with each other. On this ground,that of the continued Union of all loyal men on thebasis of the Constitution, may we still look confidentlyto see our great Republic shine in more thenpristine glory; but the man does not live who willsee it come back on the basis of Sumner's controldespotism.â€”Boston Post.
