 "I lay this down as the law of nations. I say that military takes, for the time, the place of all palinstitutions, and SLAVERY AMONG THE REST;and that, under that state of things, so far from its beingtrue that the  where slavery exists have the management of the subject, not only the  OFTHE UNITED STATES, but the COMMAND OF THE ARMY,HAS POWER TO ORDER THE UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATIONOF THE SLAVES. . . . From the that the slaveholding States become the theatre of a war,CIVIL, servile, or foreign, from that instant the war powersof Comme extend in interference with the  ofslavery, IN EVERY WAY IN  IT CAN  INTERWITH, from a claim of indeity for slaves taken or destroyed,to the  of States, duced with slavery, toa foreign power . . . . It is a war power. I say it is a warpower; and when your country is actually in war, whetherit be a war of invasion or a war of insurrection, Congresshas power to carry on the war, and  CARRY IT ON, ACCORDINGTO THE LAWS OF WAR; and by the laws of war,an invaded country has all its laws and municipal institutionsswept by the board, and  POWER TAKES THEPLACE OF THEN. When two hostile ar are set in martialarmy, the commanders of both armies have power to all the slaves in the invaded territory."â€”J.Q. ADAMS.      NITED TATES OMMAND  RMY              DAMS.
