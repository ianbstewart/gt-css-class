 The peculiar policy of the Know-Nothing cannotbe carried out, except through the action of theFederal Government. Naturalization law a cannotbe repealed or modified but by Congress. Foreignborncitizens cannot be left out of the numerousoffice under the Federal Government, but throughthe exercise of the patronage-power of the President.All that the Know-Nothings have done inthe States is merely preliminary. They claim tobe a National party, and their chief concern iswith National objects. Acting in their severalStates, in State affairs, and under the oath of secrecy,it is easy enough to manage in reference tothe Slavery Question. All they have to do is tohave a prudent reference to public opinion; andthe absence of any 'platform' on the subject ofSlavery facilitates this accommodating policy. Inone section, their action is pro-slavery; in another,anti-slavery; in another, simply anti-administration,or non-committal. Let us recapitulate: Mr. Benton, the only Republican from Missouri,who cherishes the anti-slavery doctrines of Mr.Jefferson, and had the courage to speak and voteagainst the repeal of the Missouri Compromise,ascribes his defeat to the Know Nothings: and theAmerican Organ, just established in Washington,as the National organ of the new Party, says: American Organ 'The final political demolition of Thomas H. Benton,(credited by himself to the votes of the Know Nothings,)was a triumph, of which our Missouri friends maybe justly proud, and upon which we congratulate theAmerican Party throughout the land'! Do the twenty thousand Free Soilers who votedwith the Know Nothing in Massachusetts respondto this? Mr. Mott, the pro-Nebraska candidate of the pro-slaveryadministration party in Pennsylvania, forCanal Commissioner, is elected by an unprecedentedmajority. Do the Free Soil Know Nothing feelproud of this result? In New York, they put up a Silver Gray FillmoreWhig, with the express view off defeatingClark and Seward. We have the testimony of theNew York Express, that the nomination would nothave been made, had Clark and Raymond remainedon the Whig Syracuse platform. which, we allknow, was non-committal as to any practical action.The probability is, that the movement has resultedin the defeat of Clark,* and in the electionof a Liquor and Nebraska candidate. What saidthe New York Know Nothing Standard, while theindications were that Seward was prostrated? InNew York, said that journal, the work of the nowparty was, 'to rebuke the higher law woollies,and all other issue, not compatible with the justrights of the People, and therefore, especially,Sewardism, and it was nobly done.' Mark! Sawardism,not as a representative of Whiggery, orMonopoly, or the Commercial Interest, but, as therepresentative of the 'higher law,' and Anti-Slaverysentiment, is to be put down. This is themission of Know Nothingism in New York, accordingto the Standard. Are our Free Soil friends preparedto sustain it in such a 'mission'? Express * Standard Standard. Hear, too, how the Richmond (Va.) Examiner,a paper which advocates slavery and the slavetrade on principle, as necessary to high civilization,approves of the Know Nothing policy in NewYork:— Examiner 'Now, as to the results. First of all, let us congratulatethe country upon the  of SEWARD.—  EWARD.  stripped him of  his  one half of his body, and  the archagitator.To the surprise of everybody, that extraordinary,invisible incomprehensible body, the Know Nothings,finished the work which Pierce began.      archagitator. They throttled Seward with the most extraordinarycase and grass, end left him, dead, mangled, lying highand dry above the lowest possible  of ill-luck, uponthe political potter's-field of New York. The Tribuneand its compatriots are now howling a wild and horribledirge over the remains of their martyr. We do notfancy the Know Nothings, but all honor to them forhaving crushed to the earth, and trampled under theirfeet, the boldest and most unprincipled fanatic that everendangered the peace of a great republic.'  Tribune Strange times these, when Fillmore Whigs. DickinsonDemocrats, Slavery Propagandists and FreeSoilers, can unite in a common Hallelujah! From the acts of the Party, let us turn to thedeclarations of their 'organs.' The New YorkKnow Nothing Standard says: 'Under these circumstances, but one course is left.'The American organization is not a institution—itextends East, West, North and South—and an entirerepudiation of every thing, like abolitionism was necessaryto preserve its integrity and unity. This independentnomination, therefore, is a guarantee to ourSouthern friends, that, whatever the parties of theNorth may do, the patriotism of the masses knows nodistinction between North and South. Whether Mr.Ullmann and his associates on the American ticket areto be elected or not, we feel convinced that the men ofreal principle attached to the American organization inthis State will vote for them, and thus exhibit theircomplete alienation from all party corruptions.' entirerepudiation of every thing, like abolitionism This independentnomination, therefore, is a guarantee to ourSouthern friends The Nashville (Tenn.) Whig copies this, with thefollowing prefatory remarks, showing the favor thenew order is beginning to find among slaveholders,fearful as they are of all secret movements:— Whig 'The leading sentiment understood to be professedby the 'Know Nothing' or 'American' party, and corroboratedby many of the results of their organization,must, in its legitimate operation, lead them to opposeevery sectionalism at war with the peace and prosperityof the Federal Union; a peculiar devotion to theperpetuity and true glory of the Union being the apparentlyrecognized basis of their existence as a party.It may be that, in some localities, incidental or othercauses have combined to place them for a time in a positionof seeming cooperation with men unsound as nationalpoliticians. But the general correctness of theirassumel national conservatism as a party, is sustainedby the labored assaults upon Know Nothingism in theNew York Tribune and the Washington National Era,especially devoted to the propagation of abolitionism andits kindred heresies, and we find another proof of theessential hostility of the Know Nothings in New Yorktowards the abolitionists, in the following explicit declarationsof the Know Nothing Standard of that city.' Federal Union Tribune National Era Standard The New Orleans (La.) Creole reprints the sameextract, finding in it a sweet odor of Nationality.It remarks:— Creole 'Nothing more satisfactory than this could be presentedto those who love the Union and defend the Constitution.In the present disorganization of the politicalelements, it is impossible to say what may be the resultof the important election which took place yesterday;but of one thing we may rest assured, that whatevermay be the result, the American party is national inits organization, its principles, and its action.' The American Organ, the National paper of theparty, is no less explicit. After committing itselfin its prospectus 'against the agitation of thequestion of slavery in Congress or out of it,' itproclaims in the first editorial of its first number,opposition to 'all "higher law" doctrines bywhich the Constitution is to be set at naught, violated,or disregarded'—thus giving currency to thealong misrepresentation of anti-slavery men sofashionable among pro-slavery politicians. Referringin another number to the project of a Constitutionalparty, started by the obsolete George M.Dallas, it inquires— American Organ 'Is it possible these politicians have not yet discoveredthat the people have themselves already formed,and raised into eminence, a new conservative party? formed,and raised into eminence, a new conservative party Have not these politicians heard from the Northwest,from the North, and from the East? Do they notknow that in New York the 'American party' is composedof sound conservative elements, entirely? Dothey not know that the 'Hards' and the 'Silver Grays'compose tbe American party in that State? Do theynot know that in Massachusetts, the Whigs, the Democrats,the Free Soilers, each ran a candidate for Governor,and that the 'American party' took up an independentconservative Union man for Governor, andelected him by a vote far exceeding all the votes castfor the three other parties? Do they not know, that theAmerican party in the' Old Bay State' is a purely nationalparty?' Whigs Democrats Free Soilers independentconservative Union man national Have Wilson, Burlingame, Knapp, DeWitt,Banks, &, become 'nationalized,' according tothe ideas of this organ of their party? Again: 'Our friends.' says this organ, 'havenever yet refused to vote for a Democratic "Hard',or a "Silver Gray" Whig, whenever such a candidatehas adopted our principles. The election ofMott in Pennsylvania, and Hincks in Baltimore, areonly two out of many instances in which Democratshave been sustained and elected by the votesof our friends.' Hard Is it true, then, that our Free Soil friends, whoare swallowed up in Know Nothingism will votefor Fillmore or Clayton, for the Presidency, providedthey be sound Native Americans? Our Union-saving 'organ' grows enthusiastic asit proceeds. The efforts of Webster. Fillmore, andthe Compromisers or 1850, to save the Union,are rivalled by what the Know Nothings have accomplishedin this line:— 'William H. Seward and his allies,' it says, 'arenew. we trust, impotent for mischief. The "Americanparty" has, in this single year, by its conservative done more for the  of the Union,than has heen done in the last twenty years, tuning andexcepting the patrictic efforts of the Union party in1850. whose labors have been renderednaught by theblundering  of this Administration.

According to this, our Free Soil friends havebeen entrapped into an Organization. whose greatmission is, to exterminate  and to revive the Compromises of  and their authors. Was it for this that Mr. performed his tour to the South, a year ago!      Again the American  brings authoritiesto  its pro-slavery position:— American    'The New York  of the  ,over the signature of "," and  the following truthful and  published in the  of Saturday to wit:              ' "The Know  and will"not  the  Theywould  they known their  in the  and  they the interior of the State, and are confident of being ablyto control both State and city elections hereafter.

'"The Anti-Slavery movement in this State has beenchecked. though it does not demonstrate any partialityfor the Nebraska bill. In fact, that question was overshadowedby the more pressing issues between the variousparties to the liquor question—i. e., 'had liquor,good liquor, and no liquor.' Both the Temperancequestion and Know Nothingism exerted more influenceupon the result than did the Nebraska question." i. e. 'It is true, strictly true, as stated by the BaltimoreSun's intelligent correspondent, that "the Know Nothingsave a NATIONAL PARTY, and will not enter into theSeward crusade against slavery." strictly true Sun's the Know Nothingsave a and will not enter into theSeward crusade against slavery.

We know of none. Now when an organization, embracing in itsmembership slaveholders and non-slaveholders,Slavery Propagandists and Free Soilers. Hards aSilver Grays, Fillmore, Clayton, Pollock, Willson,and Burlingame, undertakes to plan its Nationaloperations, and select its National candidates,what will be done? Shall the candidates be anti-slaveryor pro-slavery—for the Fugitive Act oragainst it—for the division of California or againstit—for Cuha with slavery or against it—for theexistence of slavery within Federal jurisdiction oragainst it? All these questions are of vital importance—the people have made up their minds onthem, pro or con—no man could be selected as aPresidential candidate, whose opinions are notdecided respecting them. Would the VirginiaKnow Nothings or the Massachusetts Know Nothingsbe willing to take a candidate on trust. withoutunderstanding his position? Would the formerconsent to vote for Pollock, or the latter forClayton or Fillmore?  pro con Let us say to our anti-slavery friends. who haveeither joined the Know Nothings or voted for theircandidacies—this new or ganization is beginning to belooked to by the South, especially by Southern Whigs,as the only basis of what they call a 'National party'—that is, a party which, ignoring the questionof slavery, will permit its policy on that questionto be silently determined by Southern management.Thed Semi-Weekly Creole, of New Orleans, speaksconfidently on this point. Referring to the prostrationof the old parties, and the indications ofan approaching sectional conflict, it looks to theKnow Nothings to prevent this evil. It says :— this new or ganization is beginning to belooked to by the South, especially by Southern Whigs,as the only basis of what they call a 'National party Semi-Weekly Creole 'It scems to be universally acknowledged that the"Know Nothings" aim to preserve our institutions asdelivered to them by the sainted heroce of '76. Theyare pledged to oppose all foreign influence, and to standby the Union and the Constitution, It were impossible,then, to be a Know Nothing and a Disunionist ;it is a contradiction in terms of adhere to the newmovement, and ignore the compromises of the Constitution,or resist the execution of the laws. * * * * * * 'If a point of union exists between the North andthe South, we verily believe it to be with the order ofKnow Nothings.

The leaders of allothers, even Case and Douglas and Benton, as well asSeward, at this moment justify their course by attemptingto prove it hostile to the South, or based on principlesof universal philanthropy.

Courier. will present acandidate for the Presidency, not only national in hisposition, but American in his heart. The people willrecognize the statesman and the patriol, and elevate himwith greater magnanimity than has been witnessed sincethe days of Washington. In another number, it reiterates these views: 'We feel confident that the South has no tangiblepoint of political union with any other party of theNorth, except the Know Nothings; that they occupy theonly national ground. The Silver Gray Whigs havebeen overslaughed by the adherents of Seward. TheNebraska Democrats claim this bill as a triumph overthe South—a victory achieved for freedom. The FreeSoilers are open in their opposition to our constitutionalrights, and the Democratic Hards are accused by theFree Soilers of having selected the same platform whichthey have adopted. With whom can the South act inthe coming national elections? Certainly, only withthose who are pledged to support the Constitution andthe laws, to maintain the Union, knowing no South, noNorth, no Edual, no West. We feel confident that the South has no tangiblepoint of political union with any other party of theNorth, except the Know Nothings; that they occupy theonly national ground. Certainly, only withthose who are pledged to support the Constitution andthe laws, to maintain the Union, knowing no South, noNorth, no Edual, no West. 'With the facts we have adduced, it is a mockery ofthe good sense of the people to ask us to affiliate witheither the Whigs or the Democrats of the North. Thereis neither patriotism nor prudence, honesty nor a devotionto the rights of the South, in seeking such alliances.' Concurrently with these declarations, we findJOHN M. CLAYTON, the auxiliary of Senator Douglasin pushing through the Nebraska Bill, althoughhe declined to vote for it finally, because it did notcome up to the standard of non-intervention—placinghimself, in a public speech, delivered beforethe late election in Delaware, on Native Americanground, advocating the Know Nothings, and predictingthe impossibility of any national unionhereafter on Whig or Democratic ground. —Speaking of the distinguished men belonging tothe order, he remarked :— OHN LAYTON 'I know not upon what authority it is stated. thatthe late President of the United States is a member ofthe Know Nothing order. But I do know, that a greatnumber of the most intelligent and patrictic men ofthis country have adopted the principles and joined thesociety of this secret party.' stated. thatthe late President of the United States is a member ofthe Know Nothing order. In relation to the main principles of the Americanparty, as he calls it, he says :— 'I will not support for office a man who claims to bea Native American, unless he plants himself upon thatplatform. If he seeks my vote, he must do it by professingmy principles. He must not tell me that comeother party besides the American party here has namisatedhim for the office. He must come out plainly,and say that he asks support on the principles of theAmericans. If he asks the support of the Americanparty. he has no right to accept, without our consent, anomination from another party, professing principleswhich we, as American, have never adopted.' unless he plants himself upon thatplatform. he has no right to accept, without our consent, anomination from another party Referring to the essitement around at the Northby the Nebraska Bill, he says :— ' for the Passless of men is required, to saveus from ourselves. At this crisis, where I think thereis for more real danger than has ever existed before.

In another part of the State, an efforthas been made to get whigs to serve on a Democraticticket, but, I hear, without success. In other States,the division among the Whigs is such, that it is quiteimpossible that another Whig National Convention canever assemble again. And if another Democratic Conventionshould again make that effort, as it probablywill, there can be no real, heartfelt concord in such aboly. A party strong enough to sustain the Governmentin the trials to which it will inevitably soon besubjected, ought to be a desideratum with every rightmindedAmerican statesman. 'An appeal to American national feeling for such apurpose ought not to be vain; and I do not believeit will be in vain. In every State and in every sectionof this Union, there is now an American party.' What remains, now, for anti-slavery men, Whig.Democratic, Independent Democratic? Shall theRepublican movement be abandoned? Shall theissue between native and foreign-born citizens besuffered to supersede the issue between Slaveryand Freedom? Shall the Anti-Nebraska movementstop midway in its course, satisfied with hivingreturned a small Anti-Nebraska majority to thenext House of Representatives, careless as towhether the next President shall be anti-slavery orpre-slavery? Will those anti-slavery men whohave united with the Know Nothing party, or votedfor its candidates, continues their support to it, inthe phase of 'nationality,' so-called, it is now assumingunder the influence of John M. Clayton,and the Fillmore men of New York? There isdanger ahead. Honest men should beware of beingplaced in a position, entangled by obligations, calculatedto give rise to conflicting duties, to obscuretheir perception of right and wrong, to temptthem to compromise or postpone the application ofvital principles. Who will give an authoritativeanswer to these questions— How are anti-slaveryand pro-slavery Know Nothings to act together, inthe selection of a Presidential candidate?
