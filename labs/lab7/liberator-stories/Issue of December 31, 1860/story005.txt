 The Union-savers of Philadelphia meet with insurmountableobstacles in their patriotic efforts tosuppress the freedom of speech in that city. Havingcontrived, through the treachery or the timidity ofthe Mayor, to prevent George W. Curtis from fulfillinghis engagement to lecture on 'Honesty,' theynext set themselves to work, by the same means, toprevent Henry Ward Beecher from delivering hispromised address on the anniversary of the Landingof the Pilgrims. Efforts were made to frighten theCommittee under whose auspices he was to appear,and induce them to withdraw their invitation. Theydeclined doing this, but were weak enough, it issaid, to write to Mr. Beecher, 'advising him to beprudent, and requesting an immediate reply, giving'the title of his address, which they hoped would beconciliatory and pacific' (!! ) Mr. Beecher hadthe good sense simply to inform theta that he shouldbe on hand to fulfil his engagement, sod that thetheme would be one which he deemed appropriate to theoccasion. After repeated failures, Mr. Palmer, theChairman, succeeded in getting a hall, only by givingbonds to be responsible in case of attack. Severalof the Committee were so fearful of a disturbance,that they dared not sit on the platform. Everyeffort was made to induce the Committee to backdown, but Mr. Beecher and Mr. Palmer stood firm.The lecture passed off uninterruptedly, and was adecided success. There was an immense audience,who were very enthusiastic; every allusion to freedomof speech, and every strong affirmation of thedoctrines of universal liberty, being applauded to theecho. Perhaps the Mayor, after this illustration ofthe public feeling, may take shame to himself foryielding to the threats of the mob, and muster courageto perform his duty.â€”Anti-Slavery Standard. thetheme would be one which he deemed appropriate to theoccasion.
