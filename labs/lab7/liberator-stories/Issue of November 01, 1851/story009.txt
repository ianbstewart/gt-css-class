From the N.Y. Independent.   Y ENRY ARAL EECHER. The topic of excitement not a days follow suchother with such rapidity, that we seem to live in adream, in which the most astonishing conjunctionsand the strength objects no longer surprise. Ourpalate is becoming need to high flavers. Nothingless than expenditions, revolutions, would alliances,monster exhibitions, have any power to arrest attention.The unparalleled history of the settlement ofCalifornia, the sudden creation of a fleet of seasteamers,surprising in magnitude the men-of-warto which we used to look up as the very mountains ofthe deep, the disastrous invasion of Cuba, the extralegal tribunals of San Francisco, by which the mobtake the place and functions of organized Justice,while the courts and government, caught in thepopular mesh, hang like skeleton flies in a spider'sweb, swinging in the wind; the escape and gloriousadvent of that most renowned of modern men—Louis Kossuth; these and such like events occuralmost daily. Once it was a thing to be spoken of,if one had doubled the Horn or the Cape; but not itis becoming as common as to go from Broadway intoWall-street. The ship that insure to-day, boundfor Canton, looks into San Francisco, cuts across thePacific, stows its Oolong and Imperial, pierces thehomeward deep with its blade-prow, and is backagain, almost before we have done talking about hersailing. The globe used to have a respctable circumference,in the days of Dutch-built ships. Longvoyages used to be talked about. We might nowalmost as well talk of long voyages in a wash-tub.—Very soon there will be no place where a villain canrun to, unless it be behind the icebergs of the PolarSea. Deserts are steadily encroached upon peered intoa little and a little further every year. And InteriorAfrica will soon be familiar whistling-ground toYankee traders, who will whittle from the Cape ofGood Hope straight through to the Nile or to Algiers!After that, there will be no place left in theworld where a man can lose himself—unless he joinsome Union Safety Committee. A man can scarcelybe found there. The topics of the morning, over a dish of coffee,are no longer the weather, the crops, the upsettingof a coach, or a sneaking burglary or two. We noweagerly count up how many scores were smashed upin the last railroad collision, and how many blowntip in the last capitally executed steamboat explosion.It is a matter of infinite pleasure to us alwaysto learn, on such occasions, that 'no one wasto blame, and that the 'utmost care was taken' bythe engineers and conductors. For, if one has acquaintances.in the calamity, it is a gratification toknow that their disaster was a fate, and not a carelessaccident; and that they died honorably by alaw of nature, not by the neglect of a stupid conductoror a drunken captain. scores fate Then, too, we sup upon no wishy-washy highwayrobberies; we effect hearty murders, and capitalhangings,—especially if the rope breaks. By theway, ought not the government to appoint a commissionon Hemp? We remember that Daniel Webstervery significantly assured the gentlemen of theSenate, we think it was, that the operation of pullinghemp, with nothing to stand on, was very inconvenient.But lately, we observe that the cords whichGovernment selects are so economically manufactured,that men find somethmg to stand on quite unexpectedly,and have to be twice hung before theyare once killed. This is not an impertinent intermeddlingon our part. We claim to have a personalinterest in this matter of hanging. Daniel Websterhas most emphatically declared that resistance to theFugitive Slave Law is treason. Judge Kane ofPennaslvania has charged the jury that the extemporaneousresistance of fugitives and their compeersto civil process waa treason. President Fillmore hassent Marshals with patriotic celerity to Syracuse, toarraign for treason all who aided and abetted therendering of a man to his liberty. Now it is quite plain that treason is to be plentiful.The prospect of harvest were never better.—We have felt the symptoms of ripeness ourselves.And as treason is a capital offence, and brings a manto hanging, it is plain that the Government has workon hand for a while to come. Every candidate forsuch honors, therefore, has a right, we think, to insistupon it that, if the Government will hang oneman for helping another to liberty, they shall atleast provide good hemp. It is against the law totry a man twice for the same offence. But ourhangmen sometimes try a fellow twice or three timesbefore they succeed. We have prejudices againstbeing hung with rotten cord. This Southern hempis not strong enough to hold the Union together, ifit is not strong enough to have weight of onetraitor. Why not drop heap entirely, (as it dropsits victims,) and try cotton? Cotton politics andcotton theology have caught the wind as well ascotton sails. Why not cotton cordage ? If cottoncordage is half as good for hanging traitors as cottontheology and cotton patriotism are for makingthem, hemp ought to be suspended. Won't theUnion Committee lry it? if Some of them, who havebeen the most intimate with cotton, have suspended;but ought they not to hang in suspense? If anyof them have a mind to try it, we will intercede forthe other conveniences requisite, so that they shallbe at no expense. But every consideration requiresthat they should use cotton. Judges tried hemp, andthe rope broke. We trust that they will so far deviatefrom his interesting experiment of selling hismaster at a bargain, as not to throw away the thirtypieces of silver, and not to try hemp. Give us themoney for the relief of fugitive slaves, and takegood cotton for haltess! and, if they love their country,do let them take cotton that won't break! treason try lry it have cotton. not us cotton do break! As for ourselves, while we regard robbery and ordinarymurder as in bad taste, we begin to have apenchent for treason. That is getting to be a gentlemanlyaffair. There are our ancestral traitors—Adams,Warren, Jay, Washington, and others, whom theBritish Government, at one time, was as intent uponhanging, as our friends at Washington now ar uponhanging Christiana and Syracuse traitors. ThusPoland has had multitudes of traitors, and theCzar of Russia has tucked them away by hundredsunder the snow-wreaths of Siberia! We recollectsome few historic names of eminent traitors in England,in the days of the struggle of men for liberty.Italy has her traitors, too, Achilli, Massisi and others.And Austria—why, she has  and nationof Union! She exports them. All England is a gogjust now at the arrival of the world's most illustriousmodern traitor, Louis Kossuth! And he goes from hisden at Katahyia is a steam-frigate of this traitor-huttinggovernment of the United States! What—importing  Will it not interfere with homemanufacture? Our enterprise in this  of domesticindustry is regard, and in a very precariousstate.

Now, let us suppose that Committee of clergymenshould be deputed to wait upon the illustriousexile (whose traitorous effigy has just been halteredand hung at home!) Of course, we should selectthose who have most pointedly in againstthe doctrine of the Higher Law. dr. Dewsy,Dr. Taylor, Dr. Spencer, Dr. Spring, Dr. Lord—could a better committee be desired?  During the quarantine of two das, which ourGovernment has ordered at Sh Island, we mayimagine thus it is the purpose of our excellent to  away all inward  of reason, aswell as outward contaminations of plague, from the illustriousexile. We will imagine that the days are tobe divided between the Church and the State. Ourclerical committee would without doubt cast a shadeof awe over the  hero, as they marched intothe cabin of the steam frigate MISSISSIPPI—(theState of repudiation and Senator Foote!)—each onebearing a presentation copy of his cermon or speechon the Fugitive Slave Law. The oldest clergymannow approaches Kossuth, and welcomes him to thisland of liberty and equality. Its blessings are described;the statistics of our prosperity are brieflygiven. 'All these things,' says the excellent spokesman,'we owe under God to our liberty. No peoplecan thrive while ground by oppression.' This lappylaudation of liberty being done, the gentlemenproceed to question his notions of law and government,patriotism and treason.       ISSISSIPPI 'Does your Excellency believe that Slavery is asin per as? Do you not regard it as a patriachalinstitution tolerated by Jehovah, not abrogated byChrist, and if properly used, a beneficent arrangementfor the blacks?' per as M. Kossuth (being perhaps more used lately to thesword than to theology) may be supposed to be alittle confused, and rather evades so unsavery acatechism. But our good divines are too expert in examiningcandidates in theology in all the nice distinctionsinto which the Trueth has been split up, to be easilydodged. And so Dr. S. says plainly, 'Would you,sir, if by uttering the prayer for it, you could releaseevery slave in America, to-morrow, dare to utter sucha prayer?' 'That I should very quickly,' responds the illustriouscatechmen, a little off his guard by the directnessof the question. The Divines nudge eachother. There is business on hand.  'Do you believe that a slave has a right to runaway from his master?' 'Do you mean to inquire by this question, gentlemen,whether I have done right in running awayfrom the service of the Emperor of Austria?' 'No, sir, oh no. You are a white man. Perhapswe ought to put the question a little more explicitly.Do you believe a black man held to slavery inSouth Carolina, has any right to run away?' The English tongue being yet a little new, Mr.Kossuth does not exactly know what South Carolinais, (an ignorance, perhaps, of which her own citizenssomewhat partake,) and supposing that it is the nameof some prison or government galley, answers, that'if a man is imprisoned for crime, he thinks he oughtto work his sentence out, whether he is white orblack.' South Carolina 'Do you think when a man is flying for his liberty,that any one has a right to help him off?' 'Oh certainly I do. I quite agree with your Government,gentlemen, who have kindly provided methis noble steamer wherewith to escape the Emperorof Austria.' 'But do you think, if a fugitive is arrested, that itis right for men to conspire together for his release,against the express laws of his native land?' 'Ah, gentlemen, you are quite familiar with mycase. I perceive that you allude to my extraditionfrom Kutahyia, against the edict of the Emperor ofAustria! I quite agree with you, gentlemen, thatthe Turks did a noble thing.' By this time, he venerated doctors whisper a momentin consultation, and conclude to leave a copyeach of their sermons and addresses in favor of obeyingthe Fugitive Slave law, and to turn down leavesupon the most salutary passages; such as this in Dr.Lord's sermon ('Union Safety Committee' edition,p. 6.) 'To plead a Higher law to justify disobedienceto a human law, the subject-matter of which is withinthe cognizance of the State, is to reject the authorityof God himself, who has committed to Governmentsthe power and authority which t hey exercisein civil affairs.' As a slave is by our lawas defined tobe a chattel, to be completely in the power of hismaster; as our laws give to the master the right totreat his female slaves as he will; to separate families,sell the children in one direction and the parentsin the other; as our civil laws protect the masterin the right of sending his own blood to marketmingled with his slaves, — it is not strange thatKossouth, on reading the passage, quite failed to seeits practical drift, and thought that it was a hint tohim to be an obedient citizen when he should havesettled down. chattel Dr. Spencer called his attention by a dog's-caredleaf to the doctrine (on page 7,) A man has noright to  away his life for a mere sentiment,and leave his wife a widow, or his gray-haired parentswithout a son to solace them.' This is a partof the statement, that citizens have no right to resistGovernment until there is a good prospecet of success.Upon this passage Ko ponders; and ashe walks up and down his now deserted cabin, hesoliloquize: 'As if the greatest achievements of theworld were not in their inception gloomy and cheerlessto all usual methods of estimation. It is theheart determined to die—it is that courage whichcries out, "Give me liberty or give me death"; itis that nobleness of nature that  to acceptlife as a burden of disgrace, and  to lay itdowness as a sacrifice to liberty; is short, it is thatsublime and heroic determination of great souls tovindicate man's manhood, living or dying, that overgiven success! Every Hungarian that has fallen is atongue of liberty in the world. Between the RussianBear and the Austrian Snake, there was but littlehope of victory for their native land. But thoughHungary has lost her best  the world has gainedthem. They stand up above all division  ofStates, and inspire men every where with hatred tooppression, and a determination to be . No, it isthe mark of a coward to be afraid  strike until heis  of victory—until he has calculated the profitand loss, and has a safe commercial prospect ofgaining! It is the very mark, in all ages, of a that he is willing to die for a "            On their way back to the city, our clerical examinersheld a grave consultation. 'Well, I am disappointed,for one. Mr.  is not so intelligent aman as I supposed. He is somewhat inclined to 'It is not to be expected that with hislimited knowledge of republican government, heshould have discriminating views of the doctrine ofliberty.

We are just now orporimentingon so many , that it may lead to vorycompari, I have therefore assembled you, gentlemen,to lay before you the question, 'How shallwe receive Kosenth without recognizing the greatprinciple on which he stands; for it is plain, that ifwe accept his principle, we cannot hold on to ourown!'                                          higherlow            his Thereupon, an ted discussion was hold. Onegentleman thought it would be policy to say so muchof Kocouth that nobody would think of them. TheSecretary of the Navy was of opinion, that statesmenand their principles were like ships and theirarmament; there must be a act for each side, besidesa few revolving gu set in the middle, and turningwith equal facility in every direction.   The Secretary of the Army thought it a plaincase. 'A stateman's read principles are mere heavyartillery, stocked in form, and never to be  unlessthe enemy attacked the fort. But then therewas another act of principles to be used in the field—light horse, skishore, and flying artillery.Now, gentlemen, I take it that Conscienos andRight, and that sort of armament, are heavy gunsnot to be used twise in a century. But obedienceto law, and patriotiem, and the duty of all citizens tokeep the compremises, these are light artillery dochingabout here and there, wheeling, twisting, firingor retreating, just as the exigency of the field requires."   The Secretary of the Treasory 'was of opinionthat the case was difficult only in theory. In preotios,he apprehended the thing might be aporatedsuccessfully. You see, gentlemen, just now, thatconscience, and old-fashioned patriotiam, and higherlaw, are non-interest paying stocks, and our fancydoctrines rule the market. A few outsiders have investedlargely in the old securities; but I thinkwe have cornered them. There never was a nimblermarket for fancies than now. Just combine, givethe old stocks another push down, rush the fanciesa notch or two up, and then, just before the reactioncomes, why, we'll sell out, and make a cleanprofit on the speculation.' preotios The Secretary of State, who had looked remarkablyheavy at the announcement of the business,gradually cheered up as these counselors proceeded,and by the time that the dozen bottles had beenuncorked, he was ready. 'Gentlemen, union is indispeneablein such a case as this. If I have beenable to render some slight service to my country informer days, I shall not be found wanting in such acrisis. This country must be saved. We musttherefore praise Kossuth, and praise America, andpraise liberty, and say as little about principle aspossible. Gentlemen, I have throughly exploredthis whole question. It is quite possible for us totake both sides, and to use both sides. We mustbelieve in liberty. We must believe in governmenttoo. Men have rights; but so have masters. Monmust obey their consciences; but they must obeythe laws too. If there is any disagreement betweenthese things, it is not for us to go into such abstructions.it is mere metaphysics. Gentlemen, no manis complete without many sides—aner murionous—myriad-minded men. I have many sides, you havemany sides; all public men have many sides. It isa wise Providence that has ordered it.

THINK OF IT. The Tyrant Fillmore is now prostitutingthe whole energies of this government TOHANG ELIJAH LEWIS AND THIRTY-SEVENOTHER AMERICAN CITIZENS for thehonor and perpetuity of slave catching! What adeclaration of infamy for this nation is the fact, thatthe wretch hopes by this wholesale act of murder topurchase a poced elevation to the preidency!Gen. Taylor butchered thousands of innocent Mexicans,and was crowned with power as his reward.Millard Fillmore thinks he knows this nation, that theblood of there thirty-seven American citizens will appothe South, save the Union, and perpetuate hispresidency.

Samuel Williams, who carries a manly heart,thoughhe wears a sable brew, is subject to a trialfor his life because he imparted warning to the intendedvictims of the same kidnappers.

Thedespots of Europe act in regard to Kossuth, the renownedEuropean slave, as the American deapotsact, in regard to our American Fugitive Slaves. Becausethe Sublime Porte released Kossuth, the Governmentof Austria is assembling troops to punishthe Porte, under pretence that be persecuted theChristians of Austria. And the French Government,the republican despot of that country, denied Kossutha passage through France. HE REAT UROPEAN UITIVE LAVE. So in the United States, our despotic Governmentdeclares war against the States that rescue fugitiveslaves, and threaten death to an American Kossuthwho shall attempt a passage through any slave State. Our Kossuths are honored in Europe, and persecutedat home. European Kossuths are honored inAmerica, and persecuted at home. Kossuth, drivenfrom Europe, comes to America. Our Kossuths,driven from America, are fring to Europe.
