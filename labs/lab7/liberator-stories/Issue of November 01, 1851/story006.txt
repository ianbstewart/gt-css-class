 ☞ The following Letters were read at the resentannual meeting of the Pennsylvania A.S. Society. Boston, Oct 4, 1851. MY DEAR FRIEND:—A sudden celd, attended withconsiderable inflammation o the image, (aside fromother considerations,) must deprive was of the pleasersof attending the Annual Meeting of the PennsylvanisAnti-Slavery Society, at West Chester, nextWeek. Whenever may be disappointment felt atmy absence, it cannot be greater than the regret Ifeel at the interposing of any ostacle to prevent mybeing with these whom I have known, loved andhonored, for so many years, as among the earliest,most notiable, most devoted friends of a serrely afflictedand horribly ontraged race. Y EAR RIEND Your Anniversary is to be held at a time of intenseexcitement, under circymstanes peculiarly trying, ina location not vey re from the Christiana tragedy.It cannot fail, therefore, to be an occasion ofthrilling interest and deep solemnity. Whatever maytranspire, I am confident that you all will possessyour souls in patience, nor think it 'strange concerningthe flery trial which is to try you, as though somestrang thing had happened unto you; but rejoice,inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's brings;''committing the keeping of your souls to god inwell-doing, as unto a faithful Creator.' 'For yet alittle while, and the wicked shall not be; but themeek shall inherit the earth. The wicked plottethagainst the just, and gheth upon him with histeeth. The Lord shall laugh at him; for he the thathis day is coming. The wicked have drawn out thesword, and have end their bow, to cast down thepoor and needy, and to slay such as he o upright conversation.Their sword shall enter their own heart,and their bow shall be broken.' 'God is our efugeand strength, a very present help in time of trouble;therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed,and though the mountains be carried into themidst of the sea.'     Truly, 'This is a nation that obeyeth not the voiceof the Lord their God, nor receiveth correction; truthis perished, and is cut off from their mouth. . . .Were they asthamed when they had committed abomination?nay. they were no at all ashamed, neitecould they blush. . . . From the least of themeven unto the greatest of them, evey one is given tocoventenances; and from the prophet even unto thepriest, every one dea ly . . . . They makea man an offende for a word, and lay a mare for himthat reporiveth in the gate, and turn saids the ust fora thing of saught. . . . Their first run to evil,and they make haste to shed immosent blood; warningand destruction are in their paths. . . . Theyall lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man hisbrother with a net. That they may do evil with bothhands earnestly, the prises saeth and the judge for a reward; and the great man, be  hismischievous desire; so they wrap it up. . . . Andhe that departeth from evil, maketh himself a prey.'    Nevertheless, ' Strengthen ye the weak hands, andconfirm the feeble knees. Say unto them that are ofa fearful heart, Be strong, fear not. . . . Hearlessunto me,' asith the Lord, 'ye that know righthe people in whose hearts is my fear; fear yenot the raproach of men, neither be ye afraid of theirrevilings; for the moth shall eat them up like a garment,and the wo shall not them like wool. I evenI, am he tht comfortheth you. Who art thou,that thou  be afraid of a man that shall die,and the son of man that shall be made as grass;and forgettest the Lord they Maker, that hath stretchedforth the heavens, and laid the foundations of theearth; and hast feared contioually every day becauseof the fary of the oppre, as if he was dy to do.s and where is the fary of the oppere? Thecaptive exile hastsmeth that he may be loosed, andthat he shall not die in the pit, nor tat his breedshould fail. . . . For the oppression of the poor,for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saiththe Lord; I will not him in ty from him that profat him. . . . Say ye not. A confederacy, toall them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy;neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. . . .Sanstify the Lord of hours hiself; and let him he yearfear, and let him be your dread.'          My dear friend, I can  language to retiable, as tie, to controlling, the time, as that which I have quoted from a volume, prodlyheld by this appressive nation in the highest as the inspired word of God, which yetdi, in the most desing moment, all its warnings , examples,  judgments.            More than three millions of our fellow- arecontinually crying for delivered from a ser'one hour of wh,' in the truthful words of TJEFFRESON, 'is fraught with more  than agesof that which our fathern ross in rebellion to oppose.'Their ment demonstration that the guilt of this is llaled. Our duty, as  iswill to ' should and  every We have nothing to —we trace—to  to mark out—no  tomake except that we have came short in real . If the Declaration of  we are sight  we are sight  We may  the world  we have  as to the oppression, these are the words of the devil, not tobe tolerated, but destroyed. Whoever undertakesto enforce them, whether called President, Judge, orCommissioner, ranks himself among the  ofmankind; and must take his place in histoery by theside of such monsters as Caligula, and A compact made at the expense of the rightsand liberties of any portion of the people is 'a entwith death and an agreement with hell; andthat covenant—so runs the promise of God—shall beannulled, and that agreement shall not stand, whenjudgment is laid to the line, and righteousness to theplummet; for the hall shall sweep away the refuge oflies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.—Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation whichkeepeth the truth may enter in. Trust ye in the Lordforever; for in the Lord Jehevah is everlastingstrength. For he bringth down them that dwell onhigh; the lofty city, he layoth it low; he layeth itlow, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to thedust. The foot shall tread it down, even the foot ofthe poor, and the steps of the needy.'     EFFRESON                                           I have just been cursorily reading a work, publishedin London in 1792, entitled, 'Thoughts and Inquiryon the Principles and Tenure of the Revealed andSupreme Law,' with reference to African Slavery,'being humbly submitted to the British Legislature,and to the public in general,' by P.W. HALL. As Ihave never seen a copy of it before, and as itcontains many things (somewhat quaintly expressed)very pertinent to our land and times, I am tempted tooccupy the remainder of my sheet with a few questions:— ALL. 'Among the most abandoned and villanous suitsof men, that of modern slavery has claimed thepre-eminence as most abominable. And it has appearedthroughout all its long continued depof men by men, as not only contrary to every of Christian virtue, but  most horrible to human nature; and which to the universal of civilized and enlightened nations, is very ingto them who have  their hands in theblood of iniquity, oppression, cruelty and by shamefully co and suffering ruffians, robbers, and  to go out fromthem to various places of the , to rob and the inhabitants; and for the purpose ofcursed avarice, to  up a  in men, as if theywere beasts, to capture, murder, and enslave the peopleof a dark complexion, and with to carry them away with  force from thecoast of Africa to  which they havefounded in oppression, injustice, murder and                      That  avarice and  wickednesshas led the tyrannica oppressors, in the  oftheir infidelity and arrogance, to form laws of of establishing  of ; enchantments of its  have no  everthe nations, that deprivation of every principle ofjustice, honesty and humanity, has  theunderstandings of men, that they have formed of government, civil policy, and lawas of commerce,diametrically opposite, and contrary to theexpress laws of revealed widsom; and every right of man.    to form laws of of establishing  of         formed of government, civil policy   The refinery of our civilization has extended and support to a  man- andslaveholders, contrary to all law, reason and justice;and the efficient execution of THE JUST LAW has noauthority over them, because  ought to be thejudges and administra of the law  the and executioners, AND PARTNERS  THE MASTER;and the only  law, either in its ,or wise and merciful itigations, is not regarded.How long shall it be, O Lord God of Hosts! thatthe people and nations will rebel against , andforsake the law? and support to a  man- andslaveholders     judges and administra of the law  the and executioners         What a covetons, wicked and tiondo we yet live in!

'O ye inhabitants of the British [American] nation,who have bewitched yes!

And as a foolish people anda rebellious nation, have you not adhered to barand laws of murder, which even would blush to ? I have no reason to you falsely; your  and  willshow the matter. Ye have put away that from you, in the  of your law, which, in other,requests, ye  to believe.

All carnal weapons I have long since renounced,but only to put on 'the whole armor ofGod,' that I may 'be able to withstand in the evil day;and havind done all, TO STAND.'                         'Glory to those who die in this great cause!Courts, judges, can inflict no brand of shame,Or shaps of death, to shroed them from applause!No, manglers of the martyr's earthly frame,Your hangmen fingers cannot touch his fame!Still in our guilty land there shall be someTrue hours, the shrine of Freedom's vestal flame:Long trains of ill may pass, ded—dumb—Mast Vangeanos is behind, and Justice is to come!'
