 In a letter dated Bristol, England, from the gentleman named, to 'the Editor of the NationalAnti Slavery Standered.' we see painful evidence of adetermined effort on the part of Mosra. Thompson.and Webbs, to place that class of Abollitionists whoact with 'the Liberty Party,' of this country, in anaboard and ridicnlous position before British philanthropists.What private griofs these gentelmenhave, alas! we know not; but one thing we can if.firm, that Mr. Thompson's course, in this respect,wears and espect exceedingly ungraceful, and  gnanimous:for to our certain knowledge, he had nomore unfilnobring friends when in this country, thanwere the faithful band of abolitionists, designated'the Liberty Porty.' When here, Mr. Thomopsonneither despined their sympathy nor their money;and it is not a little strange that he should, so soonafter his return to his native land, exert his maguificentoratorical powers in the work of their disparagement.  NationalAnti Slavery Standered.  'the Liberty Porty. It is to hoped, however, that the friends of humanityin England will weigh well the statement andreasonings of Mr. Thompson, before they condemn aParty, the standard-beaver of which is GERITSMITH of Peterboro'—a name that needs the prefixof no adjective to commend it to the love and admirationof Philanthropists throughout the world. ERIT MITH It appears that, at the meeting in Bristol, (of whichMr. Webb furnishes the Standard with an account,)Mr. Mathews, the Free Mission Baptist from theUnited States, look occasion to explain the claimsand merits of the Liberty Party. Mr. Webb says: Standard 'He (Mr. Mathews) was followed by Mr. Thompsonwho took his arguments and statements to picees,and exposed in strong terms, the absurdity and dupllcityof their political enterprise under the name ofAnti-Slavery action, as compared with the onalaughtof the Abolitionists upon the selfshneas and hypocrisywhich form the true corner-stones of the systemof Slavery. He showed that the Liberty Party hasrepesatedly fallen to pices—that it has no principlesof cohosion—that it is liable to all the  bywhich meor policinians are apt to be botrayed fromthe path of truth and consisteney—and that, until thisAmerican people are indoctrinated into a sense of thisan, disgraceful  and folly of Slavery, it is vain toexpect them to logislate upon it. Germison's doctrineis so simple and luminous that he who runs may read,What is, then, to prevent that Liberty Party from puttingforth some exposition of their views that shallrecommend itself, as Garrison's does, to every enlightenedconscience which is ubiased by seet and undimmedby selfishness? I have seen Gerrit Smith's Letterand Lynander Spooner's Treatise. But they areponderous argaments. Who can take them in? EvenFrederisk Douglans's transcond  ability was unableto master them, until he had  for along time at thefeet of the Liberty Party Gamlied; and I fear thatnow, with all his talent and with the help of all theseal that converts feel, he will find it very difficult tocommunicate his convictions to any of those who annot already fascinated by the American passion forpolities. However, although Mr. Mathews is a selousadvocats of the Liberty Party, he will not suceredin convincing many in these parts of the stabilityof its moral foundations, or of the  forwardnessof the assumptions by which it is up. It is difficult to most Englishman to turn theirattention to the complicated political movements ofthe United States, or to make them understand howthey can be made use of to much purpose for theabolition of Slavery, until the nation has been arounedand ealightened to the cuormity of the system.'       New Mr. Thmopson is the last man in the worldwho should 'expouse, in strong term the athurdityand suphieity of the Liberty Party.' It does not well in a member of the British Parliament,who has aworn to support the British constitution,with its anoumalies, and who has  as hard andas long as Mr. Thompson to convince the people ofhis constituency that it was for their interest and politicalwell-being to elect him to that high position,now to deal in the lanugage of self-rigtsous scorntowards politics. athurdity suphieity   elect 'He exposed, in strong learns, the abouridty andduplicity of the Liberty Party.' He did oh? Well!we should like to have heard him. 'The is bad enough. This 'aburdity' is a thing of aman's thinking; but the charge of 'duplissity' sarrieswith it the implication of weakness, hypocrisy,corruption; and the Liberty Party is guilty of neither.'The absurdity and duplicity' of the Liberty Partyin this country, are precisely what 'the abourdityand duplicity' of Mr. Thompson were when heacted with the British Abolitionists for the overthrowof Slavery in the West Indias. The same as whenhe acted with Mesars. Cabden, Bright, Wilson,Thompson, and other distinguished colitioisns in promotingthe election of men to Parliament who werein favor of the Abolition of the corn laws, and wouldvote for none other. 'The absurdity and duplicity'of 'the Liberty Party' are precisely what Mr.Thompson's 'abourdity and duplicity' were whenhis became a 'director of the East India Company,'according to his own showing a most hearthless body.in order that be might reinstate the dethround 'Rajahof Sttars,' and otherwise advance the political interestof India.  'duplissity But, says Mr. Webb; 'He  that the LibertyParty has respestedly fallen to ' If he attemptedto do this, 'he showed' what was not true, sincethere has been no such repeated falling to pices ofthe Liberty Party, as alloged. The resoning whichwould condemn the Liberty Party, because of theapontacy, even of a majority of its members, wouldbe  if applied to 'the American Anti-SlaverySociery' itself for its whole history has been markedby withdrawals, separations, divisions and schismeThe statement that the Liberty Party 'has no principlesof ' is virtually saying that it has nopriciples at all; for, if it have principle held incommon by its members, they form the cohesireband of union; and we think that if the LibertyParty have no other than the principle of humanfreedom to bind it together, it could not be honestlyarrirmed to be destituts of the  Asto the 'liberty to ' to which the LibertyParty is exposed haven help us all including even friends,  and Thompson who if we  have in their was upon the Liberty Partynot only been  have  to the to corve a party at the exposes of the cause ofthe  That an Anti-Slavery moral must  Anti-Slavery  in this country.in  by no men  than by the membersof the Liberty  and to be  told it byMr. Webb, as a  of now light on the  in The  that the Liberty on the  of may be  by themwho know nothing of the  of  will be  where course in more and where testimony to Anti-Slavery truth is moreconsistent, straightforward, and stringent?

Mr. Webb asks, with apparent simplicity, 'what isthat to prevent the Liberty party from paing forthsome exposition of their vise, that shull recommend itselfas Garrison's d, to every entighted conssience,which is urbiased by seat, and unmmed by selfishness?Most incocently put, barring the crookednessof the sentence! We must regret that thereis too great a resenblance in the reception given tothe expositions of the Liberty Party, and that whichhas hitherto attended the exposition of Mr. Garrison.There must be few 'enlightened coniences'left in this unhappy world, if those only are so whoaent entirely to the 'expositions' of Mr. Garrison!'I have seen Garrit Smith's letter,' says Mr. Webb.We should like to know which? for Gervit Smithhas written many letters on the subject of slavery,during the last 18 or 20 years, and if they could allbe collected, they would not fall short of filling upfriend Webb's garret, in Dublin. We are glad thatMr. Webb does not pretend to have read GerritSmith's 'letter;' he only speaks of having 'seen' it.The sight of it was doubtless enough for him. hesaw enough to convince him, that both 'Mr. Smith'sletter and Mr. Spencer's trustine, are ponderous arguments.'We agree with the latter of this conclusion,though we may dissent from its spirit, for webelieve the arguments to be not only weighty, butunannerrable. 'Englishmen' may not be quite asclear in mental vision, as some of us apprehended;still we cannot believe, with Mr. Webb, that it isdifficult to make them understand the necessity andappropriateness of political action in this countryfor the abolition of slavery. Indeed, we found itdifficult to make 'Englishmen' understand howslavery could be otherwise abolished. The philosophyof infusing a correct moral sentiment into thegovernment, by means of voting for good men, andagainst bed once, has been too often advocated inEngland by George Thomson, Esq., M.P., not tobe pretty easily comprehended throughout the realm.If, however, 'Englishmen' need further light uponthat subject, let them attend Mr. Thompson, in oneof his electioneering compaigns through the TowerHamlets, and if they are not then initiated, we shellunite with the haters of England, and call John Bulla stupid fellow!! what isthat to prevent the Liberty party from paing forthsome exposition of their vise, that shull recommend itselfas Garrison's d, to every entighted conssience,which is urbiased by seat, and unmmed by selfishness       enlightened coniences   entirely expositions I have seen Garrit Smith's letter letter seen Mr. Smith'sletter and Mr. Spencer's trustine, are ponderous arguments. unannerrable.
