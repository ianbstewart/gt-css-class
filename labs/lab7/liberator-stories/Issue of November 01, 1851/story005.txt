 ACTS xxi. 13: 'I am ready not to be bound only,but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the LordJesus.' CTS Here is another example of the moral hereisonwhich has chamoterined the great reformers of everyage. It is a specimen of the spirit of a devotedfollower of truth—of the intrepidity and firmness withwhich a real lover of Right follows the dictates ofConecience and the voice of Duty. In the instancewhich called forth from Paul the language ofthetext, the entreaties of his friends had no power toperuade him not to go to Jerusalem, although hewas promised bonds and death as a reward for hisI  to elevate man, and free him from the thraldomof error and of sin. In the face of these, hefaltered not; his duty was plain, and like a nobleand heroic man, he followed in its path, regardlessof consequences, declaring as willingness even todie for the name of Christ.     What a coust between the conduct of this noblelover of truth, and many professed followers ofChrist at the present day! Little more than a yearsince, an act passed our national legislature, and receivedthe executive sanction, requiring northernfreeman to vislate the dictates of their conscience—to violate their accord religion—to violate theirhonor and feslinge as men, by denying the rites ofhospitality to those fireing from a system of iniquityand outrage more terrible than death, or by turningblood-hounds to hunt them down, and aid in returningthere to the southern bull of whipe and chains.  What is the manifest duty of the Christian, whencalled upon to obey this law? Shall be acknowledgeits claims as being higher than the claims of the lawof Justion and of Right, or submit from a fear of itspenalties? If so, he possnes not the spirit of thetext.—he is a moral coward, and unworthy the nameof Christian. For the cause of Christ, which is thecause of humanity, he should be willing to suffernot only fines and bonde, but also death.  Temperising priests may tell us that as long asthis is a law of the land, it is over duty as good otineasot obey it; but in so doing, they are guilty ofdark hersey and fearful chery to God! Theirwords are full of falshood and blasphemy, for theyteach that God's claims and laws can be not aridefor a time, and that we most violate them rather thanan constment of corrupt and wicked mon! DidDaniel thus when he was commanded  to call uponhis God? No! he noticed not the dearce of awicked king, notwithstanding the fearful penalty ofthe law. He violated a law of the land! and theministry are loud in commencing his heroism andunfaltering adherence in the cause of truth in no deing;and yet some of than deslam it to be the dutyof good citizens and Christians, to obey a law ofCongress not less tysemisal and wicked than thedecree of Dan     He violated a law of the land   Christina I will ye obey God or man? Now isthe time to deside, if ye have not already, for acrisis, a fearful criis mill , you has already come.The informal gang of slave hounds are huntingdown their victims, and will ye aid them in theirHeaven—defying work, or will ye be true to yourselssand the cause of Christ, and trumple this infamouslaw into the  its penalties andthe threats of the paupered tyrants who would enforceit? In a word, are ye! ready not to be boundonly, but to dis for the name of the Lord Jesus,'and in the cause of His down- humanity?If ye pos His spirit, ye are; for no , noconstitution, no human con whatever, can fora  tempt youto  in the perof your duty. Are ye  like Christ, like like Paul, to  your  ofTruth? Are ye ready is  s dutyand aid the  in  him  the of                        For my  I  of the  my  that iffor the  of
