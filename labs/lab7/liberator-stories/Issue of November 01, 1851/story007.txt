 BOSTON, October 7th, 181. OSTON DEAR FRIEND.—Your letter has just reached me.It is tool late, therefore, to obey its call, ever if ithad been possible for me to do so. I have an exngagementto assist at the dedication of a school-housein my native town, on Friday, and could not be withyou. EAR RIEND. It is now a very trying time with us all. It haslong been plain, that the two Ideas of America—theIdea of Freedom and the Idea of Bondage—were entirelyincompatible; all attempts to unite them mustfail. Peace measures, which seek a compromise betweenthe two, will always turn out measure of war.One of the two must be eradicated. The questionis not merely, 'Shall thee be slavery in one part ofthe nation?' but if it is, then the question is, 'Shallthere be freedom in the other part?' It is not possible.The South cannot keep slavery to itself; theNorth cannot keep freedom to itself. It will passover the borders. The events of the last two yearshave shown to all, with half an eye, what was plainenough before to a clear-sighted man, that slaverymust be uprooted from the South, before our freedomat the North is secure. A great criais has now come. The Federal Governmenthas openly and publicly declared itself infavor of the Idea of Bondage, and hostile to theIdea of Freedom. The President is for slavery; theCabinet is for slavery; the Whig party is for slavery;the Democrats are for slavery; the leading merchants,with few, a very few exceptions, are infavor of slavery; the leading newspapers, politicaland commercial, are in favor of slavery; theleading clergymen, as a general thing, have been trueto the instinct of their class; have sided with money,sided with power, and with the oppressor against theoppressed. I think there are not ten prominent politiciansin the United States that dare lift up theirvoice for freedom; I don't know of five prominentclergyment who do so. In Boston, whose is most traintorotisis honored most. The kidnapper walks unrebukedin our streets; his minister defends the businessof stealing men, does it publicly, in the pulpit ofJesus, and in the nae of God. One of th richestmen in the city is said, on good authority, to be theowner of more than a hundred human beings. Ithink he would be more honored and respected byhis associates, if the fact were known. If he shouldset them all free, he would be honoured less than if eshould sell them to-morrow. The great crime of Dr.Palrey is, that he set free and watched over the fellow-menwhom his father held in bondage. The sinof Horace Mann is only this, that he loves freedomand bates slavery. The offence of Charles Sumneris, only that he believes the first principles of theConstitution of Massachusetts, and of the Declarationof Independence. Even in Massachusetts, the seedof the Puritane, we have but a few men whodare defend the great principles of Eternal Justice.An attempt has been made to convince the peoplethat there is no law above the declarations of Congress;an attempt to establish Atheism as the firstprinciple of government.  Well, my friend, these are hard time; times ofcorruption, evil times. 'He that serveth the Lordbecometh a prey.' Yet I think they are gloriousthese, . I am glad that the crime has come; itwill be over all the sooner. The two Ideas, the falseand the true, are now in open battle; every electionis affected by this anti-slavery movement; we cannoti the question; it is fairly before the people;they see only a little of its extent; the whole will appearin due time. I have no fear for the result.Pennsylvania may recade from the right; even Massachuesettsmay recede; it will be only for a day; theywill both come back to the True and the Right, andgive it their hearty approval, their hearty love. Godwill give it triumph.   I am glad that some black men have been foundat last, who dared to resist violence with powder andall. They are driven back to the elementary instictsof human nature. The law is against them;the Constitution is against them; public opinion isagainst them; and the kidnapper arms to take theirbodies. Men who reverence our thers for throwingBritish Tea into Boston Harbor, and shooting todeath the British soldiers at Lexington and BunkerHill, cannot fail to do honor to negroce who repel violenceby violence, and shoot the kidnappers. Perhapsyou will hang them for treason. I suppose allthat the money, all that the talent, all tht the corruptionof the American Government can do to securethe condemnation of those men, will be done. Ishall not be prised i some of them are hung,said the houses of De and Whigs, and withthe blessings of the clergy on the judicial crime. Butof old time, the blood o the martyrs was the seedof the church, and the crew who made his meal onthe gibbet, was the carrier pigson who bore glad of great joy to these who waited for the consolationwhich Liberty was  to bring. I, I rejoice that a negro has shot a kidnapper.Black men may now hold up their heads before thesehanghty Cauns, and say, 'Yes  that we alsocan fight. The power to kill is not a monopoly ofthe slave-hu!' But I dep violence! let usdo without it while we can, for ever if we can. I ambe non-resistant; yet I am glad the leading anti-slaverymen are so—that, great as is the right of Liberator,they would not shad a drop of blood to achieve itfor all mankind; for though I think their doctrines they are yet nearer right, I thibk, them the notions. Let us have firmness withoutfight, as long as possible.              I am carry my friend Garrison cannot go to your. I wish it was possible for me to bet, and say one word in behalf of the right. As it i s, I can only give you my hearty goodwill and  desire that your Convention may neitherforget its valor nor its distion—neither itsJustice nor in Love.      Truly yours,THEODORE PARKER.
