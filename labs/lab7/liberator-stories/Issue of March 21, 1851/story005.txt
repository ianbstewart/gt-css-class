 These meetings have been attended with brilliantsuccess, and have given as impetus to the cause ofhuman freedom beyond the most sanguine expectationsof those most deeply interested in them. The two days' Convention at Syracuse was oneof the most imposing and thrilling occasions whichit has ever been our privilege to witness. The CityHall was densely packed at every scession, with anaudience which appeared to know no weariness. Mr. Thompson addressed the meeting five timesduring the two days, and to say that his eloquentwords fell on the sager ears of the listening multitudewith surpassing effect is but small praise. Thefirst ten minutes of his first speech were sufficientto grind into powder, and cast to the wild winds, thewhole cart-loads of newspaper slanders which hadbeen maliciously thrown in his pathway. His triuoaphwas complete. The meeting at Syracuse was presided over byGerrit Smith. Those who know him, need not betold that, in the chair, there were combined dignityand ability. We hope to have the proceedings ofthis meeting for publication in the next number of'the Star.'
