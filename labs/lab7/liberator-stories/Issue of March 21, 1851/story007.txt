We  over, for the present, Nos. 7, 8 and 9 ofBrother Mathews' Letters from Kentucky, that ourreaders may have, at the earliest moment, his accountof the barbarons treatment inflicted upon himby the lynchers. He visited the village of Richmond,Madison county, with a view to lecture on themoral and religious condition of the slaves; buted, after applying to three or four different churches,of obtaining a house for that purpose. On Sundayevening, Feb. 16, he preached by invitation tothe colored congregation; after which he was assailedby a mob, and, with some personal indignities,but no serious injury, driven from the town.Proceeding to the residence of Cosmius M. Clay, atWhitehall, he prepared for the Chrenicle, a newspaperpublished at Richmond, a statement in relationto the doings of the mob, with which he left forFoxtown on the morning of the 18th, as stated in thebeginning of the letter below.   BRYANTSVILLE, Feb. 20, 1851. RYANTSVILLE DEAR DR. WALKER:—My communication to theChronicle of Richmond, was placed in an envelopeby Caseions M. Chy, together with a letter writtenby himself to the Editor. On arriving at Foxtown,I found that I was a minute too late for the state. Asit was only 6 miles to Richmond, and as I was anxiousthat the communications should appear in the nextnumber, I concluded to walk to Richmond. Arrivedthere, I called at the Chronicle office, handed to theEditor pro tem the communications, requested himto send his next number to the American Baptist,passed down the street, and that my stay might beas brief as possible, called into a store, and obtaineda few apples as a substitute for a dinner. I now pursuedmy way to the Big Hill, thinking that the informationI had gained previously, (that the publicfeeling had not contained the mob,) was correct.Reflecting on these things, I concluded that my passingthrough the village would prove salutary ratherthan otherwise. EAR R. ALKER pro tem When nearly a mile from town, I was overtakenby four men riding on horses,—one, the bar-tender atWebster's hotel; another, Mr. Turner, who wasdressed in a drab coat; another, a slim built man,who wore a round-topped hat and a long coat; theother was of my own height, dressed respectably, andwore whiskers. They enquired of me, 'Where now ' I replied,that, having an appointment at Big Hill, I was goingto fulfil it. They placed their hands within theirvests, and said, 'If you make the least outcry or resistance,you shall die instantly. You must go withus; we will put you in the road to Lancaster.' 'Now,;said they, 'did you not agree not to come back toRichmond?' I them told that I made no such agreement;if they supposed so, they must entirely havemisunderstood me; and that now I had simplyparsed through the village, on the way to myappointment. We turned from the main road througha gate, crossed a field, entered a lane, and went downit some distance, turned to the right through anothergate, and finally descended into a valley throughwhich runs a very small creek, and where we werein sight of an out-house, which I understood them tosay belonged to Mr. Bronston. They then hitchedtheir horses to the fence, and the bar-tender of Webster'sHotel, seizing my arms, brought them behindme, and bound them with a horse bridle. They arrangedthemselves in front of me, and enquired,'Are you an Abolitionist?' I stated that I did notbelieve that the slaves ought to rise and resist theirmasters, but that I believe in emancipating them,and that I was laboring to bring the moral power ofthe church to bear against slavery. They took ahandkerchief, folded it, and bandaged my eyes.—Supposing I was about to die, I began to pray aloud;but this drew from them oaths and threats. Theythen seemed to be waiting for some one to brigsome tar and feathers; but the person they expectednot coming, they consulted what should be done withme. One thought he could obtain some tar andfeathers by being absent a little while. They askedme if I had not said, in Richmond, that it wasright for slaves to run away, and that I would helpthem. I told them I had not. 'Did you not,' saidthey. 'tell the Methodist minister that slaves couldnot get to heaven, if they did not run away from slavery?'I told them I did not. After further questions,they consulted whether I should be whipped,tarred and feathered, ducked or hanged. At lastthey decided to duck me. We had to go some distanceto a pond. The bandage from my eyes wastaken off, but my bands were still bound. Havingto go over some fences, it afforded them sport to seeme go over them bound. In some cases, they wouldtake off a rail or two, and in one case assisted me.Arrived at the pond, Mr. Turner, the owner of thefarm, came up. 'Here,' said they, 'we found thisman stealing your hogs.' He seemed to understandtheir object. I now asked that I might be allowedto take off my two coats, and place my bible,watch and pocket book in the pocket of my overcoat.To this they consented. They then asked meif I could swim. I told them I could, but did notknow that I could with my clothes on. One of themsaid a stone ought to be tied to me, that I mightsink to the bottom. They brought me to the edgeof the water. The bar-tender on my left, and Mr.Turner on my right, seized and flung me as far asthey could into the pond. Before rising to the surface,I swallowed considerable water, and nearly lostmy breath. When I approached the shore, as nearas where the water was waist high, I paused to gainbreath. They commanded me to come to the shoreinstantly. I implored them to allow me to gain mybreath. But they reiterated. 'Come out instantly.'As soon as I reached the shore, they took me, andthrow me in again, head . On my regainingthe shore, they threw me in the third time. Oncoming out, they required me to promise never tocome to Richmond, or into Madison county, anymore. I declined promising, and they threw me inthe fourth time. I then made the promise. Theynext required me to leave Kentucky, and never returnto it. I refused, and they threw me in the fifthtime. On coming to the shore, they again requiredme to make the promise; I refused, and they determinedto whip me. They led me to a tree, andtied up my arms as they tie up slaves when theyflog them. They tied a bandage round my eyes, sotight as to pain them exceedingly. But finally theyconcluded to duck me again. They led me along,when, putting up my hand, I pulled off the bandage,and found Turner leading me to the pond. Heblamed me for pulling off the bondage. they threwme (as before) into the pond the sixth time. I stillrefused to promise. Another  of hands took hold,and threw me in the seventh time. I refused topromise. They threw me in the eighth time. I refusedto promise. They threw me in the ninth time.I refused to promise. They threw me in the tenthtime, and I refused to promise. They now resolvedto whip me. As I approached the shore, Ifound all the powers of nature giving way. Ithought of my intention, in coming into Kentucky,to leave if they would not hear me lecture. I thoughtalso of the vast amount of work yet to be done inthe free States; and the; if I lived, I could tell thefree States of this treatment; and I believed that itwould do good to make it known. , halting in thepond, what of life there was in me promised to leaveKentucky, and never return. The bar-tender mid,'Do you swear, so help you God, you will leaveKentucky, and never return?' I replied, I solemnlyaffirm, I will leave and not return. They then assuredme that I should have men to watch me tothe borders of the States; that if I ted to goto  M. Clay's or as the  pike toLexington, I should be killed,— would be out.to watch; that I must go by Lanouster, and theretake the stage for Lexington; and if I ever resrnedto the State, they would hang me wherever theycould find me, or even if I told how I had been trustedbefore leaving the State;—that I must take theLonaster state the next morning for Lexington. Isee add so more now.  die instantly.        MADRSON, Ind., Feb. 22, 1851. ADRSON I resume the subject of my treatment by thelychera. After execting the pre to leaver theState by way of Lanoaster, they told me I mightchange my deres. I made an effort to unlock mycrpat bag, but shock so much with the cold that Iwas unable to do so, and one of the lynohers openedit for me. They seemed to regard my articles inthe carpet _bag as quite as much under their controlas their own property, stating that they wantedmy anti_slavery tracts, papers, &c. I put on dryoweks drawers,  and cotton shirt. During thistime, it being in the open air, and the 18th of February,I was very cold, and felt cramping pains in anylega. Having no change of pantaloons, I had to puton the wet ones which I had just taken off, My vestI pleased in a handkerchief together with the remainderof my wet clothes. They now required the anti_slaverybooks. I handed out a bundle of 'Politicosand the Pulpit,' Wesloy's Thoughts or Slavery','Lewis Tappan on the Unconstitutionality of theFurtive Slave Bill', and the 'Liberty Minstrel'.—One of them opened the latter, and began to read.   'Gone, gone, sold and gone,To the rice_swamps, dank and lons'.  As I thought that stealing a few books could addbut little to the blackness of their guilt, I told therethey might have the books—I would give them tothem. They thought the Liberty Minstrel, beingnicely bound, ought to be paid for. I told them Iwanted nothing for it,—they might keep it. Findingthat they determined to pay for it, and fearing itmight add to my sufferings if I made the issue that Iwould not receive the money, I received fifty centsfor it, simply as the safest course for myself underthe circumstance. One of them called it a fairtrade. Ah, thought I, if it facilitates my concaps fromyour hands. They enquired if it was a cold daywhen I was baptized, and whether I ever had such abaptizing before,—and many other things in ridiculeof my religious faith. They enquired what was thought by different personsof the treatment I received on Sunday night.'Now', said they, 'had you come to Richmond, andpursued the same course as other ministers, you wouldhave been treated with the greatest kindness andhospitality'. I told them that the manner in whichI had been treated that day would add no sorrow tomy dying hour. I had not expressed my views itRichmond, in regard to the right of slaves to noraway. I had, however, last year, in the State ofNew York, reported a speech made by Brother Glenin which he showed that as persons could serve Godbetter in freedom than in slavery, every slave wasmorally bound to run away. I had stated that theargument was conclusive. This was published inthe American Baptist, and had been seen by theRichmond Methodist minister. Hence they chargedme with saying to him, that slaves could notget to Heaven, unless they should run away. Ifound that they had received a communication fromMayslick, saying I had been threatened with lynchingthere. The bar tender now took out a pair ofscissors, and cut off a lock of my hair to send tothe editor of the American Baptist. We now repairedto the Lancaster road, and the lynchere, onhorseback, rode to Richmond, while I, on foot, carryingmy wet clothes and carpet_bag, started forLancaster,—a dirt road of 22 miles, moddy, andcrossed by creeks. I now had fellowship with theslaves in their sufferings more closely than ever before.The lynchers had forbidden me to have anight's rest before reaching Lancaster. I walkedabout five miles over a muddy road. I was nowweary, faint, hungry, and port of my clothes wet.Besides, the road forked, and it was too dark forme to road the direction. To lie down in the fieldswould probably ruin my health. To ask protectionof slaveholders was, from my situation, to becomethe object of suspicion. But it was the best alternative.I approached a house, and ashed if I couldobtain supper. This was cordially granted. I thenstated my case and treatment. The slaveholder,Mr. M., said, 'If I thought you had come to stealone of my niggers, I should immediately shoot you.'He then dwelt on the benefits of Colonization, whileI dried my pantaloons at his fire. I told him my futurehealth would depend on my having the privilegeof staying all night, and inquired if I might doso. He consented to it. That kind act of his, in allprobability, prevented me from taking a cold fromwhich I could never have recovered. A fire waslighted in my bed_room, and I sat up till midnightwith his son, drying my clothes. The latter sympathizedwith me in my trial. I lay down, but thatnight slept not a minute. The next morning I startedat 5o'clock. I was as unsuccessful as on the previousevening in hiring a horse. I walked fourmiles, crossing a creek by moonlight, on a damwhich was some what dangerous. I breakfasted ata tavern, walked two miles farther, and, for $1,50,hirred a horse and boy to go to Lancaster. We arrivedsafely. I had now travelled 20 miles, and was10 miles farther from Lexington than when at Richmond.I was still in danger, for I had told of thetreatment I had received, before leaving the State.I know hired another horse, and the tavern_keepersent his slave on another, to take the horse backfrom Breyantaville. I began now to feel somewhatsecure. But the mail carriers came, inquired meout, and made it known that I had been lynched.—I was again the object of suspicion. The tavern keeperat Bryntsville was a Buptist slaveholder, andI told him I thought I would go on toward Lexington.His son persuaded me to stay. The nextmorning the stage came; the passengers were allduly informed. The inside was filled. I took myseat on the outside, the rain falling in torrents. Thecompany cracked their jokes upon me, singinghymns swore, drank, and denounced the Ernacipationist.Arrived at Lexington, I found that sore ofmy Richmond enemies were looking out for me. Iwalked down to the railroad office, dried my clothes,and that evening reached Frankfort. I found I wasstill watched. The next day I came on to Madison,and felt how good it was to land in a fee State.—Last Sunday, Feb. 20, preached three times to thetolored Baptist Church in this place. Yours for the Slave,EDWARD MATHEWS.
