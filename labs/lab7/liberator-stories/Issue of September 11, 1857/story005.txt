 The following capital speech is as pertinent now, asit was as the time of its delivery before the New EnglandAnti-Slavery Convention, May 23, 1846. Its author,Rev. S.L. POMESOY, is now a member of the AmericanBoard of Commissioners for Foreign Missouri,and as dumb as say D.D. (see Irish 56:10) in theland. He 'did run well for a time; what did hinder; OMESOY MR. PRESIDENT,—The ground of the principles ofanti-slavery are, that it is the duty of all men, everywhere, to do right. There is a right, and there is awrong, in every act requiring moral agency. Onwhich side are you? Now, as friends of emancipation,we say that if any one in doing wrong, heshould leave off doing wrong; not next year or nextweek, when he has done more wrong, but now, atthis moment, before he can do any more wrong.Slavery is wrong. It never can be right. The longerit is persisted in, the greater will the wrong accumulate.This is our principle—cause to do wrong!We proclaim it in peace and love. We want to emblazesit on the heaven, to blow it through a trumpet,'Let the suppressed go free!—until every our ismade to hear, and every heart to feel and believe;and so soon as men are convinced it must be done,we shall have no trouble about the mesas—therewill be a way to effort it. It is in this belief, thatour starting principle is pulsed on a foundationwhich cannot be moved, that I call are elution:— R. RESIDENT right. 'Let the suppressed go free! Resolved, That no valid objection can be urgedagainst the principles and measures of the Anti-SlaverySociety. Ours is the golden rule,—Do unto others he yewould that others should do unto you.' Who, than,if he were a slaves would not wish to be free?Would you ask for colonization, or far immediateemancipation? Every moment you keep the slavein bondage, you violate the low of love; and yetwe are told, that if we knock off the fetters of theslave, and let him go free, H would be very cruel tohim indeed, and we ought to keep him in slaverysome hundred years longer, until we can civilizeAfrica, and prepare a place to send him there, wherehe will trouble nobody but people of his own color!Is this the low of love? It this the way you wouldwish to be done by, if you were slaves in a foreignland, or in the land where you were born? This is the right test to settle this question by.Come down at once to the condition of the slave,and make it your own. How long would a freeman like to live in slavery? Suppose we were allSlaves, assembled here to discuss our right to be free,how long should we propose to have the process goon, of making us freemen? Would we wait till ourchildren or grand-children should take our places?No. There would be but one voice, and that voicewould be, immediate emancipation! immediate emancipation! But it is said that we cannot elevate the people ofcolor here, and we must send them to Africa, in orderto elevate them; though they never can be elevatedmuch any where, because their skins are somuch darker than ours. And who are we, the palefaces, but a small portion if mankind, a new race,comparatively? And yet we rise up, and say ourcolor is the only true color, and all other color isincapable of being elevated to our standard! I denyit. God made the soul of man of no particularcomplexion, and he is no more a respecter of colorsthan he is a respecter of persons. The colored peoplenot only can he elevated, but they are many ofthem elevated, even under all the discouragementsand prejudices they have to contend against. I went to visit a colored family, with several gentlemen,recently, in Philadelphia. The father wasseventy years of age, with a family of three daughters.We found them elevated and refined, with acultivation of mind and manners that would haveadorned the best society. When we left the house,the clergymen, who were with me, said to eachother, 'We talk of elevating these people; and becausewe are white, and-they are black, we doubtwhether they ever can be elevated to our condition.'So strongly impressed was the gentleman who madethis remark, that he shed tears at the recollection ofthe scene he had witnessed. These people were elevated,in spite of every thing to counteract theirown efforts. The idea of inferiority of intellect inthe people of color is wholly without foundation.We falsely attribute to natural organization, the irresistibleinfluence of circumstances upon our coloredpopulation. Go to the intelligent slaveholderhimself, and ask him if his slaves are incapable ofbeing elevated. He will laugh at you, if you tellhim that his favorite slaves are not equal in facultiesto white men. To say they cannot be elevated, is to say that thegospel cannot purify and elevate colored men; andif the gospel cannot do this, then it must he a settledpoint that either the colored man or the whiteman is to be shut out of heaven. Both cannot gothere, unless both are alike capable of being elevatedby the teachings of the gospel. But some people say that we have no right tomeddle with this matter. 'We at the North have,nothing to do with slaves, and need not trouble ourheads about their management at the South. Thatthis is the affair of their masters, and we have noconcern with it! Now, sir, if this is a good argument, I call uponsome of those who urge it to move, at the nextmeeting of the American Bible Society, of whichthey are members, to stop their promos, and printno more Bibles to meddle with, the concerns of ourpeople. Let them move, in the Missionary Societies,that the missionaries they have sent abroad tomeddle with other people's sins be forthwith calledhome, for we have no business to interfere with theconcerns of the unconverted, and most not troubleour beads about their worship of idols, and the sacrificeof victims to their superstitions and their falsegods! Will them men follow this advice, whilethey recommend to as to leave the slaveholders aloneto do an they please? By no means. No one thinksof 'applying this doctrine to any thing but' the Anti-SlaverySociety. If the' Greeks are struggling forfreedom three thousand miles off; If the Poles aresuffering under the despotism of Russia; we canthen interfere—Oh, yes! it is the highest duty ofpatriotism and benevolence to interfere, and help toset them free; all the eloquence of the press andthe pulpit is roused to induce us to interfere; butwhen we point to these poor colored people, right inour own basted land of freedom, here in our midst,the answer is, 'Let them die—let their mastersscourge and oppress them as they will—we have noright to interfere!' No one thinksof 'applying this doctrine to any thing but' the Anti-SlaverySociety. I have no faith in this doctrine. I believe that,as long as there are souls to be saved, we have nothingto do with every man on the globe, as far asour influence can he made to reach; especially havewe something to do with more than two millions ofAmericans whom we of the North consented theSouth should hold in bondage, and so far, have becomeparticipators hi the guilt of slavery. Thiswas the sin of our fathers. The people of theNorth have upheld slavery, and made it constitutional.The guilt is theirs, and it is their duty torepair the wrong they have aided in doing to an innocentrace. They can do it, and do it effectually;for whenever the North will rise as one man, and demandthat the slaves shall be free, it will be done.God calls upon as to break their chains, not by violence,but by the resistless moral force of truth.We have got a great deal to do, and we can do agreat deal, to bring about the emancipation of morethan two millions of our fellow-man. But it is said, 'Why do you make so much noiseabout it here, at the North, where there are noslaves? Why don't you go to the South, and preachto the slaveholders there? You can be very boldand bluster here, but you don't true to go to theSouth, and hold forth year anti-slavery doctrines.If you were sincere you would go others, and peachto those who need it.' Now, we Yankees know better these this. Wedon't go to work in this way to accomplish an importantobject. We know that we can reach theslaveholder more efficiently here, than we could notthe South. Why, Sir, you know if we went to theSouth, and attempted to tell them the plain truth,they would gag us, and perhaps put un in jail, or offera reward for our heads, as the refined Legislatureof Georgia did for our brother here, (Mr. Garrison,)so that we should have as chance to preach thetruth. But, so long as we have the freedom ofspeech and of the press here, we can reach the slaveholder,and produce an impression upon him whichhe will long resist, but from which he cannot finallyescape. It is the power of truth, and it will provide.I saw a Tennessee slaveholder, the other day,and I asked him if the had ever heard of the Anti-SlaverySociety? His reply was we are well informedof your presenting. We know what youare doing, and our infested main us slave to year. I am think you make us angry, but Itell you honestly, and other slaveholders, if theyspeak-honestly, will tell you so too, we think youwill eventually accomplish your object; but I thinkyou are going too fast. The time, he thought, hadnot yet come for our principles to find favor in theslave states, but it must come one day or other, andhe was prepared for it, but not now: These werethe views of an intelligent slaveholder in the West.He had heard of anti-slavery doctrines. Sir; youcannot touch a cord in this great republic that doesnot vibrate through the whole. Every pulsation atthe North is felt at the South. Every effort madefor home emancipation strikes there. Intelligenceis sought after. Their own sensitiveness on thissubject, an undefined consignees that they areholding a species of property to which they have nojust claim, induce them to seek after intelligence, tolearn what is going forward in the march of publicopinion, which is calling louder and louder for theemancipation of the slave. Sir, we are doing justthe thing to enable the slaveholder to accomplishhis own wishes, in being relieved from the curse ofslavery. We are bringing the minds of the publicto a conviction that slavery mast be abolished, andwhen that conviction becomes universal, it will bedone. I repeat, there will be no difficulty in findingthe means.  But it is said that the Constitution and laws recognizeslavery, and, therefore, we have no right tomeddle with it. Just so the Constitution and thelaws recognized the foreign slave trade, a few yearsago. Why did we undertake to meddle with that,am deprive the slave-dealer of his very profitablecommerce in human flesh? Was it right to carryon the slave trade when it was not prohibited bylaw? And if it was not right to traffic in the soulsand bodies of men abroad, can it be any more rightto do so at home? Let those who talk of slaverybeing constitutional and lawful, restore the slavetrade in all its glories; for it is right to hold slaves,and sell them here, it verily must be right to importthem, and buy and sell them abroad. right abroad home? here abroad. Those who think to stop our mouths by sayingthat slavery is sanctioned by the Constitution andlaws, mast go upon the principle that bad laws arenever to be changed. We do not seek to violate thelaw, but to change it; change it by the resistlessforce of public opinion. Why, Sir, law and customformerly sanctioned drinking rum and brandy, andthey do so still, though to a less extent—but doesthat make it right? Ought you to stop in the temperancereform, because it is lawful for men to selland to drink ardent spirits? Why do you meddlewith the rights and the profits of the rum-trader, ifwe are not to meddle with the rights and the profitsof the slave-trader? The law and the Constitutionprotect one, as much as the other; and, instead ofdepriving the slaveholder of his property, we meanto increase it, by giving him free labor instead ofslave labor. right? lawful But be the laws as they may, the laws of fallibleman cannot make that which is morally wrong, evenpolitically right, or expedient, or useful. The question is not what are the laws, in this respect, butare the laws right? If-they are morally and politicallywrong, then the thing for us to do is not toresist such laws, but to see that they are repealed;and to this end to quicken and extend public opinion,until Legislatures are forced to repeal such unjustlaws. If there is a stain on our boasted Constitution—a stain of blood—let us hasten to wipe itoff. We seek to redeem the Constitution from thedisgrace of making our Declaration of Independencea falsehood; and' it is because we love ourcountry, that we desire to see her laws recognizingslavery forever abolished. morally wrong politically right blood There is another objection which is urged againstthe Anti-Slavery principles with great earnestness.They tell us, 'Your plan is to emancipate the slavesat home; but, O! horrible! just as sure as you letthe slaves go free, they will turn right round andstab their masters, and the land will he delugedwith blood!' In other words, if you do right, by.these your oppressed fellow-men; if you say to themyou are free; if, instead of exacting their labor,as slaves, at the end of the whip, you employ themas your laborers, by natural agreement, and givethem the benefit of them voluntary industry; if youundertake to treat them in this manner, why thanthey will certainly stab you for it, on the spot! free right free Stab you for it? No! These poor, crushed beings,to whom the voice of kindness and freedomwould come like an angel of peace, toll them theywere free, that you wanted their services as men,and not as slaves, and they would fall at your feet,and help you, and hold themselves in readiness todo any labor in their power for you; you wouldthan have willing hands and grateful hearts aroundyou, instead of the half-starved, wretched and beatenslave, brooding over his wrongs, and thirstingfor vengeance on his oppressors. free I do not understand that, Mr. President. It isthe strongest doctrine in the world, that if you doright, and give a man just what he most wants, hewill he so angry, that he will take your life for it!Look at it a moment, and the argument refutes itself.All facts in history show that immediateemancipation has always proved a safe remedy.How was it in Mexico? The colored people wereplaced on an entire equality by the Constitution.There was no stabbing of masters there, no murders,no violence, and no necessity for expatriation.Instead of slaves, they had the same men as freelaborers. So in Sooth Africa, the Hottentots, regardedas the lowest race of men, were emancipatedat a blow, and Dr., Clarke informs as that they atones became industrious and orderly citizens.—Wherever the experiment has been tried, it has resultedin improving the condition not only of theslave but of the master, by giving the latter thebenefit of free labor, instead of slave labor. But we are told to look at St. Doming, with itshorrible massacres and terrible devastation,—andthey say, it is a true picture of immediate emancipation.It is not so; and thorn who assert that itis are either ignorant of history, or wilfully misrepresentit. The memories of St. Domingo hadnothing to do with emancipation. France, whena Republic had proclaimed freedom to the slaves ofher colony is St. Domingo, They were then emancipatedin a body, and the historian relates thatthey were employed as free laborers, and workedpeaceably and and industriously; so much so, thathe says they carried on whole plantations themselvesin the absence of their employers, who were nevermore prosperous than at this time. When Napoleonwas supreme in his power, some of the planters ofSt. Domingo proposed to give him a large sum ofmoney to carry on his were, if he would reduce thecolored people there again, to slavery. It pleasedthis men of , who thought more of a victorythan of the liberation of millions, and he sentout an army to  the colored people of St.Domingo, and reduce them to slavery. Whenthere men, who had  of freedom, heard ofthis, they resolved to  another than submit to puton their chains again. They fought for freedom,and drove out the French who had been sent to conquerthem, and swept from the Island every Frenchmen,with a terrible destruction. That was freeman of the memory of St. Domingo; not emancipation,but an attempt to make slaves of man who,had been emancipated sh was the spirit of thesemen, that the whole power of France, in the daysof Napoleon, was unable to subdue them. They retreatedto the mountains, out off the resources oftheir feat, and  compelled them to leave themin the enjoyment of freedom, which they have ever maintained. Our fathers resisted a tax ontea, even unto blood, and we rejoice in their deedsof patriotic valor. But they were not threatenedwith slavery, as the people of St. Domingo were,when they resisted the power of France.        slavery These facts, which I have related of the historyof St. Domingo, may he found in French history,and are indisputable. But there a one other objection, and the only oneI will notice, which is, made a great handle of byour opponents:—'You will dissolve the. Union,'say they, 'if you preach upon Anti-Slavery!'This is the knock-down argument. If we dare totell the truth, to proclaim the rights of man, andinsist that the Declaration of Independence is not afalsehood, why then, to be sure, we shall dissolvethe Union! So far from this being true, we regard our objectas the only effectual means of preserving the Union.We want to save the Union. Slavery is the mother ofall those sectional divisions and heart-burnings whichthreaten the dissolution of the Union. The greatpolitical struggle is between free labor and slave labor;and if slavery continues, the Union cannot continue.It is so black, so full of evil, so perniciousin its influences, that there will be no security, nopeace, no permanent national prosperity, till it isdone away. The great eternal and just God willnever bless a people which holds in its embrace andcountenances such an evil in the land as the slaveryof more than two millions of our fellow-men. Letour politicians and our public men do what theywill, they may depend upon it, we shall never be onenation, and one people, until slavery is done away. slavery continues, the Union cannot continue. great we shall never be onenation, and one people, until slavery is done away. Mr. Pomeroy said, that in the course of his remarkshe had alluded to the arguments of theslaveholder, that the condition of the slave was improvedby his being held in bondage, and that wehad no right to interfere with his privilege of holdinghis slaves as property, because it was securedto him by the Constitution and laws. These andother arguments of the apologists of Slavery wasforcibly presented, in a petition which he wouldsuppose was presented, some thousand years ago,from the Egyptians to the Senate of Egypt, concerningthe Hebrews. He then read the followingfrom the New-York Evangelist:— Evangelist To the Princes and Lords of Egypt, in Senate assembled: To the Princes and Lords of Egypt, in Senate assembled: 'The petition of the undersigned, being free hamcitizens of the land of Zoah, shewoth— 'That we, your petitioners, are all honorable andjust men, and as much attached to the religion andinstitutions of the land as any clam of Pharaoh's subjects. 'That your petitioners, on the faith of compacts,have embarked all their property in building Pyramids. 'That your petitioners verily believe that the buildingof Pyramids cannot be earned on at all by free labor. 'That, therefore, your petitioners were induced, according;to the law of nations, to make slaves of theHebrew shepherds. 'That the state of slavery is the most congenial tothe Hebrew intellect and rank in existence—and thattheir state in slavery is infinitely superior to their formerstarving and perishing state in the land of Canaan. 'That if your petitioners had no motives of humanity,yet that, from motives of interest and profit,they would look after the health and comfort of theirslaves, as much as the proprietors of any other cattlewould look after their heads in the lands of Goshen. 'That the slaves like their situation well, andwould remain perfectly satisfied with their easy andcomfortable condition, wear it not tot the officiousmeddling of a gang of canting, hypocritical missionaries,and a junta of despicable estate in the Senate,headed by the upstart Moses. 'That the slaves, though they much love their presentstate, are some of them, exceedingly stubborn—and others runaway from their work—and that, therefore,your petitioners are obliged to brand them, in orderto know them, and also to use a scourge and agoad, in order to keep them at their work; but, generallyspeaking, the scourge and the goad are ratherthe insignia of power in the drivers than instrumentsof cruelty. 'That year petition in hear with horror and indignationof an unjust and iniquitous requisition of emancipatingthe Hebrew slaves totally and immediately,which your petitioners cannot contemplate withoutshuddering at such a gross violation of vested rights. 'That your petitioners beg permission to declare,temperately but firmly, that if this clamor about theHebrew slaves shall be continued, we your petitionwill oppose it with force and arms, and will declareourselves independent, and dissolve the union. Andyour petitioners will ever pray.'
