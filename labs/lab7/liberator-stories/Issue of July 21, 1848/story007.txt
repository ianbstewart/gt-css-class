 The Senate having under consideration thebill to establish a Territorial Government in Oregon— Mr. Calhoun said: There is a very striking differencebetween the position in which the slave-holdingand non-slaveholding States stand in referenceto the subject under consideration. The desire no action of the Government; demandno law to give them any advantage in theterritory about to be established; are willing toleave it, and other territories belonging to the UnitedStates, open to ah their citizens, so long asthey continue to be territories, and when they ceaseto be so, to leave it to their inhabitants form suchgovernments as might suit them, without restrictionor condition, except that imposed by the Constitution,as a prerequisite for admission into theUnion. In short, they are willing to leave thewhole subject where the Constitution and the greatand fundamental principles of self-government placeit. On the contrary, the non-slaveholding States,instead of being willing to leave it on this broadand equal foundation, demand the interposition ofthe Government, and the passage of an act to excludethe citizens of the slaveholding States fromemigrating with their property into the territory,in order to give their citizens and those they maypermit the exclusive right of settling it, while itremains in that condition, preparatory to subjectingit to like restrictions and conditions when it becomesa State. The 12th section of this bill is intendedto assert and maintain this demand of thenon-slaveholding States, while it remains n Territory,not openly or directly, but indirectly, by extendingthe provisions of the bill for the establishmentof the Iowa Territory to this, and by ratifyingthe nets of the informal and self-constituted Governmentof Oregon, which, among others, containsone prohibiting the introduction of slavery. Itthus, in reality, adopts what is called the Wilmotproviso, not only for Oregon, but, as the bill nowstands, for New Mexico and California. Theamendment, on the contrary, moved by the Senatorfrom Mississippi, near me, (Mr. Davis,) is intendedto assert and maintain the position of the slaveholdingStates. It leaves the territory free andopen to all the citizens of the United States, andwould overrule, if adopted, the act of the self-constitutedTerritory of Oregon and the 12th section,as far as it relates to the subject under consideration.We have thus fairly presented the groundstaken by the non-slaveholding and the slaveholdingStates, or, as I shall call them for the sake of brevity,the Northern and Southern States, in their wholeextent, for discussion.  The first question which offers itself for considerationis: Have the Northern States the powerwhich they claim, to exclude the Southern fromemigrating freely, with their property, into territoriesbelonging to the United States, and to monopolizethem for their exclusive benefit? It is, indeed, a great question. I propose to discusit calmly and dispassionately. I shall claimnothing which does not belong to the SouthernStates, either as members of this federal Union, orappertaining to them in their separate and individualcharacter; nor shall I yield any which belongsto them in either capacity. I am influenced neitherby sectional nor party considerations. If I knowmyself, I would repel as promptly and decidedlyany aggression of the South on the North, as Iwould any on the part of the latter on the former.And let me add, I hold the obligation to repelaggression to be not much less solemn than that ofabstaining from making aggression; and that theparty which submits to it when it can he resisted,is not much less guilty and responsible for consequencesthan that which makes it. Nor do I standon party grounds What I shall say in referenceto this subject, I shall say entirely without referenceto the Presidential election. I hold it to be infinitelyhigher than that and all other questions of the day.I shall direct my efforts to ascertain what in constitutional,right, and just, under a thorough convictionthat the best and only way of putting an endto this, the most dangerous of all questions to ourUnion and institutions, is to adhere rigidly to theConstitution and the dictates of justice. With these preliminary remarks, I recur to thequestion. Has the North the power which it claimsunder the twelfth section of this bill? I ask, at theoutset, where is the power to be found? Not certainlyin the relation in which the Northern andSouthern States stand to each other. They arethe constituent parts or members of a commonfederal Union, and, as such, are equals in all respects,both in dignity and rights, as is declared byall writers on governments founded on such Union,and as may be inferred from arguments deducedfrom their nature and character Instead, then, ofaffording any countenance or authority in favor ofthe power, the relation in which they stand to eachother furnishes a strong presumption against it.Nor can it be found in the fact that the South holdsproperty in slaves. That, too, fairly considered,instead of affording any authority for the power,furnishes a strong presumption against it. Slaveryexisted in the South when the Constitution wasframed, fully to the extent, in proportion to thepopulation, as it does at this time. It is the onlyproperty recognized by it; the only one that enteredinto its formation as a political element, bothin the adjustment of the relative weight of theStates in the Government and the apportionmentof direct taxes; a' d the only one that is put underthe express guaranty of the Constitution. It is wellknown to all conversant with the history of theformation and adoption of the Constitution, that theSouth way very jealous in reference to this propertythat it constituted one of the difficulties bothso its formation and adoption, and that it wouldnot have assented to either, had the convention refusedto allow its due weight in the Government,or to place it under the guaranty of the constitution,Nor can it be found in the way that the territorieshave been acquired. I will not go into the particularsin this respect at this stage of the discussion.Suffice it to say that the whole was acquired bypurchase out of the common funds of all the States,the South as well as the North, or by arms andmutual sacrifice of men and money, which, insteadof giving any  in favor of the powerclaimed by the North, on every principle of rightand justice, furnishes strong additional presumptionagainst it.  But if it cannot be found in either, if it exists atall, the power must be looked for in the constitutionalcompact which binds these States togetherin a Federal Union; and I now ask, can it be foundthere? Does that instrument contain any provisionwhich gives the North the power to exclude theSouth from a free admission into the Territories ofthe United States with as peculiar property, and tomonopolize them for its own exclusive use? If itin fact contains such power, expressed or implied,it must be found in a specific grant, or be interredby irresistible deduction from some clear andacknowledged power. Nothing short of the oneor the other can overcome the strong presumptionagainst it. That there is no such specific grant may be interred,beyond doubt, from the fact that no one hasever attempted to designate it. Instead of that, ithas been assumed, taken for granted, without aparticle of proof, that Congress has the absoluteright to govern the Territories. Now I conclude,if it does in reality possess such power, it may excludefrom the Territories whom or what theyplease, and admit into them whom or what theyplease, and of course may exercise the powerclaimed by the North to exclude the South fromthem But, I again repeat, where is this absolutepower to be found? All admit that there is nosuch specific grant of power. If, then, it exist atall, it must be inferred from some such power. I ask, where is that to be found? The Senatorfrom New York, behind me, (Mr. Dix,) points tothe clause in the Constitution which provides that'Congress shall have power to dispose of and makeall needful rules and regulations respecting theterritory and other property belonging to the UnitedStates.' Now, I undertake to affirm, andmaintain beyond the possibility of doubt, that, nofar from conferring absolute power to govern theTerritories, it confers no governmental powerwhatever; no, not a particle. It refers exclusivelyto territory regarded simply as public lands. Everyword relates to it in that character, and is a whollyinapplicable to it, considered in any other characterbut as property. Take the expression 'disport of,with which it begins. It is easily understood what'it means when applied to lands, and is the properand natural expression regarding the territory inthat character when the object is to confer the rightto  or make other disposition of it. But whoever board the expression applied to government,and what possible meaning can it hare when soapplied? Take the next expression, 'to make allneedful rules and regulations.' There regardedseparately might indeed be applicable to governmentin a loose sense; but they are never so appliedin the Constitution. In every case where they areused in it, they refer to property, to things, or someprocess, such as the rules of court, or of the Houseof Congress for the government of their proceedings,but never to government, which always impliespersons to be governed. But, if there shouldbe any doubt in this 'case, the words immediatelyfollowing, winch restrict them to making 'rulesand regulations respecting the territory and otherproperty of the United States,' must effectuallyexpel it. They restrict their meaning beyond thepossibility of doubt to territory regarded as property.  But if it were possible for doubt still to exist, an-otherand conclusive argument still remains toshow that the framers of the Constriction did notintend to confer by this clause governmental powers.I refer to the clause in the Constitution whichdelegates the power of exclusive legislation to Congressover this District, and 'all places purchasedby the consent of the Legislature of the State inwhich the same may be, for the erection of forts,, , dock-yards, and other needfulbuildings. 'The places therein referred to, are clearlyembraced by the expression, 'other property belongingto the United States,' contained in theclause I have just considered. But it is certain,that if it bad been the intention of the framers ofthe Constitution to confer governmental powersover such places by that clause, they never wouldhave delegated it by this. They were incapable ofdoing a thing an absurd. But it is equally certain,if they did not intend to confer such power overthem, they could not have intended it ever territories.Whatever was conferred by the same wordsin reference to one, must have been intended to beconferred in reference to the other, and the reverse.The opposite supposition would be absurd. But,it may be asked, why the territory was omitted inthe delegation of exclusive legislation to Congressover the places enumerated? Very satisfactoryreasons may, in my opinion, be assisted. The formerwere limited to places lying within the limitsand jurisdiction of the States, and the hitter to publicland lying beyond both. The session and purchaseof the former, with the consent of the Statewithin which they might be situated, did not oustthe sovereignty or jurisdiction of the State. Theystill remained in the State, the United States acquiringonly the title to the place. It, therefore,became necessary to confer on Congress, by expressdelegation, the exercise of exclusive power of legislationover this District and such places, in order tocarry out the plan of the purchase and cession. Itwas simply intended to withdraw them from underthe Legislatures of the respective States withinwhich they might be, and substitute that of Congressin its place, subject to the restrictions of theConstitution, and the objects for which the placeswere acquired, leaving, as I have said, the sovereigntystill in the State in which they are situated,but in abeyance, as far as it extends to legislation.Thus, in the case of this District, since the retrocessionto Virginia of the part beyond the Potomac,the sovereignty still continues in Maryland in themanner stated. But the case is very different inreference to territories lying as they do beyond thelimits and jurisdiction of all the States. The UnitedStates possess not simply the right of ownershipover them, but that of exclusive dominion and sovereigntyand hence it was not necessary to excludethe power of the States to legislate over them, bydelegating the exercise of exclusive legislation toCongress. It would have been an act of supererogation.It may be proper to remark, in this connection,that that power of exclusive legislationconferred in these cases must not be confoundedwith the power of absolute legislation. They arevery different things. It is true that absolute powerof legislation is always exclusive, but it by nomeans follows that exclusive power of legislationor of government is likewise always absolute. Congresshas the exclusive power of legislation as faras this Government is concerned, and the StateLegislatures as far as their respective governmentsare concerned, but we all know that both are subjectto many and important restrictions and conditions,which the nature of absolute power excludes.   I have now made good the assertion I venturedto make, that the clause in the Constitution reliedon by the Senator from New York, so far fromconferring the absolute power of government overthe territory claimed by him and others who agreewith him, confers not a particle of governmentalpower. I having conclusively established this, thelong list of precedents cited by the Senator to propthe power which be sought in the clause, falls tothe ground with the fabric which he raised, and Iam thus exempted from the necessity of referring tothem, and replying to them one by one. But there is one precedent referred to by theSenator unconnected with the power, and which,on that account, requires particular notice. I referto the ordinance of 1787, which was adopted by theold Congress of the Confederation while the Conventionthat framed the Constitution was in session,and about one year before its adoption, and ofcourse on the very eve of the expiration of the oldConfederation. Against its introduction I mightobject that the acts of the Congress of the Confederationcannot rightly from precedents for thisGovernment, but I waive that. I waive also theobjection that the act was consummated when thatGovernment was is extremis, and could hardlyconsidered compos mentis. I Waive also the factthat the ordinance assumed the form of a compact,and was adopted when only eight States werepresent, when the Articles of Confederation requirednine to form compact. I waive also thefact that Mr. Madison declared that the act waswill out shadow of constitutional authority, andshall proceed to show from the history of its adoption,that it cannot justly be considered of any bindingforce. extremis compos mentis. Virginia made the cession of the territory northof the Ohio, and lying between it and the Mississippiand the lakes, in 1784. It now contains theStates of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsinand a very considerable extent of territory lyingnorth of the latter. Shortly after the cession, acommittee of three was raided, of whom Mr. Jeffersonwas one. They reported an ordinance for theestablishment of the Territory, containing, amongother provisions, one of which Mr. Jefferson wasthe author, excluding slavery from the Territoryafter the year 1800. It was struck out. On thequestion of striking out, every Southern State presentvoted in favor of it; and what is more striking,every southern delegate voted the same way, Mr.Jefferson alone excepted. The ordinance wasadopted without the provision. At the next session,Rufus King, then a member of the Congress,moved a proposition very much in the sameshape of the sixth article (that which excludes slavery)in the ordinance us it now stands, with theexception of its proviso. It was referred to acommittee, but there was no action on it. A committeewas moved the next or the subsequent year,which reported without including or noticing Mr.King's proposition. Mr. Dane was a member ofthat Communities, and proposed a provision the sameas that in the ordinance as it passed, but the committeereported without including it. Finally, anothercommittee was raised, at the head of whichwas Mr. Carrington of Virginia, and of which Mr.Dane was also a member. That committee reported,without including the amendment previouslyproposed by him. Mr. Dane moved his proposition,which was adopted, and the report of thecommittee thus amended, became the ordinance of1787. It may be inferred from this brief historicalsketch, that the ordinance was a compromise betweenthe Southern mid Northern States, of whichthe terms were that slavery should be excludedfrom territory upon condition that fugitive slaves,who might take refuge in the territory, should bedelivered up to their owners, as stipulated in theproviso of the 6th article of the ordinance. It ismanifest, from what has been stated, that theSouth was unitedly and obstinately opposed to theprovision when first moved; that the propositionof Mr. King, without the proviso, was in like mannerresisted by the South, as may be inferred fromits entire want of success, and that it could never bebrought to agree to it until the provision for thedelivery up of fugitive slaves was incorporated in it.But it is well understood, that a compromise Involvesnot a surrender, but simply a waiver of theright or power; and hence, in the case of individuals,it is a well established legal principle, that anoffer to settle by compromise a litigated claim, inno evidence against the justice of the claim on theside of the party making it. The South, to herhonor, has observed with fidelity her engagementsunder this compression; in proof of which I appealto the presidents cited by the Senator fromNew York, intended by him to establish the fact ofher acquiescence in the ordinance. I admit thatshe has acquiescence in the several acts of Congressto carry it into effect, but the Senator is mistakenin supposing that it is proof of a surrender, on herpart, of the power over the territories which heclaims for Congress. No: she never has, and Itrust she never will, make such a surrender. Insteadof that, it is conclusive proof of her fidelityto her engagements. She has never attempted toset aside the ordinance, or to deprive the territory,and the States erected within its limits, of anyright or advantage it was intended to confer. ButI regret that as much cannot be said in favor of thefidelity with which it has been observed on theirpart. With the single exception of the State ofIllinois—be it said to her honor—every Other Stateerected within its limits have pursued a course andadopted measures which have rendered the stipulationof the proviso to deliver up fugitive slaves,nugatory. Wisconsin may also be an exception, asshe has just entered the Union, and has hardly hadtime to act, upon the subject. They have gonefurther, and suffered individuals to form combinations,without an effort to suppress them, for thepurpose of enticing and seducing slaves to leavetheir masters, and run them into Canada, beyondthe reach of our laws—in open violation, not onlyof the stipulations of the ordinance, but of the Constitutionitself. If I express myself strongly, it isnot for the purpose of producing excitement, but todraw the attention of the Senate forcibly to thesubject. My object is to lay hare the subject underconsideration, just as a surgeon probes to the bottomand lays open a wound, not to cause pain tohis patient, but for the purpose of healing it. [Here Mr. Hannegan and Mr. Corwin expresseddoubts as to the accuracy of the statement in referenceto their respective States, which was followedby remarks by Mr. Calhoun and Mr. Butler, his Colleague.] I come now to another precedent of a similarcharacter, but differing in this, that it took placeunder this Government, and not under that of theold Confederation. I refer to what is known as theMissouri compromise. It is more recent, and betterknown, and may be more readily dispatched. After an arduous struggle of more than a year onthe question whether Missouri should come intothe Union, with or without the restrictions prohibitingslavery, a compromise line was adopted betweenthe North and the South; but it was doneunder circumstances which made it nowise obligatoryon the latter. It is true, it was moved by oneof her most distinguished citizens, (Mr. CLAY,) butit is equally so that it was carried by the almostunited vote of the North against the almost unitedvote of the South; and was thus imposed on thelatter by superior numbers, in opposition to herstrenuous efforts. The South has never given hersanction to it, or assented to the power it asserted.She was voted down, and has simply acquiesced inan arrangement which she has not had the power toreverse. and which she could not attempt to dowithout disturbing the peace and harmony of theUnion—to which she has ever been adverse. Actingon this principle, she permitted the territory ofIowa to he formed, and the State to be admittedinto the Union under the compromise, without objection;and that is now quoted by the Senatorfrom New York to prove her surrender of thepower he claims for Congress. LAY To add to the strength of this claim, the advocatesof the power hold up the name of Jeffersonin its favor, and go so far as to call him the authorof the so-called Wilmot proviso, which is but ageneral expression of power of which the Missouricompromise is a case of its application. If we mayjudge by his opinion of that case what his opinionwas of the principle, instead of being the author ofthe proviso, or being in its favor, no one could bemore deadly hostile to it. In a letter addressed tothe elder Adams, in 1819, in answer to one fromhim, he uses these remarkable expressions in referenceto the Missouri question: "The banks, bankrupt law, manufactures, Spanishtreaty, are nothing. These are occurrenceswhich, like waves in a storm, will pass under theship. But the Missouri question is a breaker, onwhich we loss the Missouri country by revolt, andwhat more God only knows." To understand the full force of these expressions,it must be borne in mind that the questionsenumerated were the great and exciting politicalquestions of the day, on which parties divided.The bank and bankrupt law had long been so.Manufactures, or what has since been called theprotective tariff, was at the time a subject of greatexcitement, as was the Spanish treaty—that is, thetreaty by which Florida was ceded to the Union,and by which the western boundary between Mexicoand the United States was settled from the Gulfof Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. All these excitingparty questions of the day, Mr. Jefferson regardedas nothing compared to the Missouri question. Helooked on all of them as in their nature fugitive,and, to use his own forcible expression, "wouldpass off under the ship of State like waves in astorm." Not so that fatal question. It was abreaker on which it was destined to be stranded;and yet his name is quoted by the incendiaries ofthe present day in support of and as the author of aproviso which would give indefinite and universalextension to this fatal question to all the Territories!It was compromised the next year by theadoption of the line to which I have referred. Mr.Holmes, of Maine, long a member of this body, whovoted for the measure, addressed a letter to Mr.Jefferson, inclosing a copy of his Speech on theoccasion. It drew out an answer from him, whichought to be treasured up in the heart of every manwho loves the country and its institution. It isbrief. I will send it to the Secretary to be read.The time of the Senate cannot be better occupiedthan in listening to it: To John Holmes. MONTICELLO, April 22, 1820. To John Holmes. ONTICELLO I thank you, dear sir, for the copy you have beenso kind to send me of the letter to your constituentson the Missouri question. It is a perfect justificationto them. I had, for a long time, censed to readnewspapers, or pay any attention to public affaire,confident they were in good hands, and content tobe a passenger in our bark to the shore from whichI am net distant. But this momentous question,like a fire-bell in the night, awakened and filled mewith terror. I considered it at once as the knell ofthe Union, it is hushed, indeed, fur the moment.But this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence. Ageographical line, coinciding with a marked principle,moral and political, once conceived and held upto the angry passion of men, will never be obliteratedand every new irritation will mark deeper anddeeper. I can say, with conscious truth, that thereis not a man on earth who would sacrifice store thanI would to relieve us from this reproach in any practicableway. The cession of that kind of property(for so it is misnamed) is a bagatelle. which would notcost me a second thought, if in that way a generalemancipation and expatriation would be effected—and gradually, and with due sacrifices. I think itmight be. But as it in, we have the wolf by the ears,and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go.Justice is in one scale, and self preservation in theother. Of one thing I am certain, that at the freepassage of slaves from one State to another wouldnot make a slave of a single human being who wouldnot be so without it, so their diffusion over a greatersurface would make them individually happier, andproportionally facilitate the accomplishment of theiremancipation, by dividing the burden on a greaternumber of coadjutors. An abstinence, too, from thisact of power, would remove the jealousy excited bythe undertaking of Congress to regulate the conditionof the different descriptions of men composinga State. This certainly is the exclusive right ofevery State, which nothing in the Constitution hastaken from them and given to the General Government.Could Congress, for example, say that thenon-freemen of Connecticut shall be freemen, or thatthey shall not emigrate into any other State? practicable expatriation I"regret that I am now to die in the belief that theuseless sacrifice of themselves by the generation of1776, to acquire self government and happiness totheir country, is to be thrown away by the unwiseand unworthy passions of their sons, and that myonly consolation is to he, that I live not to weep overit. If they would but dispassionately weigh theblessings, they will throw away against on abstractprinciple, more likely lo be effected by union thanby scission, they would pause before they would perpetratethis act of suicide on themselves, and of treasonagainst the hopes of the world To yourself, asthe faithful advocate of the Union, I tender the offeringof my high esteem and respect.

Twenty-eight yours have passed since there remarkablewords were penned, and there is not athought which time has Dot thus tar verified; andit is to be feared will continue to verify until thewhole will he fulfilled. Certain it is, that be regardedthe compromise line as utterly inadequateto arrest that fatal course of events which his keensagacity anticipated from the question. It was buta "reprieve." Mark the deeply melancholy impressionwhich it made on his mind: "I regret that I am to die in the belief that theuseless sacrifice of themselves by the generation of1776, to acquire self-government and happiness forthemselves, in to be thrown away by the unwise andunworthy passions of their sons, and that my onlyconsolation is to be, that I shall not live to weep overit" Can any one believe, after listening to this latter,that Jefferson is the author of the so-called Wilmotproviso, or ever favored it And yet there are atthis time strenuous efforts making in the North toform a purely sectional party on it, and that, too,under the sanction of those who profess the highestveneration for his character and principles! But Imust speak she truth: while I vindicate the memoryof Jefferson from so foul a charge, I' hold he isnot blameless in reference to this subject. He committeda grant error in inserting the provision hedid in the plan he reported for the government ofthe territory, as much modified as it was. It wasthe first blow—the first essay "to draw a geographicalline coinciding with a marked principle, moraland political." It originated with him in philanthropicbut mistaken views of the most dangerouscharacter, as I shall show in the sequel. Others,with very different feelings and views, followed,and have given to it a direction and impetus which,if not promptly and efficiently arrested, will end inthe dissolution of the Union and the destruction ofour political institutions. I have, I trust, established beyond controversy,that neither the ordinance of 1787, nor the Missouricompromise, nor the precedents growing out ofthem, nor the authority of Mr. Jefferson, furnishesany evidence whatever to prove that Congress possessesthe power over the territory claimed by thosewho advocate the 12th section of this bill. Butadmit, for the sake of argument, that I am mistaken,and that the objections I have urged against themare groundless—give them all the force which canbe claimed for precedents—and they would nothave the weight of a feather against the Strongpresumption Which I, at the outset of my remarks,showed to be opposed to the existence of the power.Precedents, even in a court of justice, can have butlittle weight, except where the law is doubtful, andshould have little in a deliberative body in any caseon a constitutional question., and none where thepower In which it has been attempted to trace itdoes not exist, as I have shown, I trust, to be thecase in this instance. But while I deny that the clause relating to theterritory and other property of the United Statesconfers any governmental, or that Congress possessesabsolute power over the territories, I by nomeans deny that it has any power over them.Such a denial would be idle on any occasion, butmuch more so on this, when we are engaged inconstituting a territorial government, without anobjection being whispered from any quarter againstour right to do so. If there he any Senator of thatopinion, be ought at once to rise and move to laythe bill on the table, or lo dispose of it in someother way, so as to prevent the waste of time on asubject upon which we have no right to act. Assuming,then, that we posses the power, the onlyquestions that remain are—whence is' it derived?and what is its extent? As to its origin, I concur in the opinion expressedby Chief Justice Marshall, in one of thecases read by the Senator from New York, that itis derived from the right of acquiring territory;and I am the more thoroughly confirmed in it,from the fact that I entertained the opinion longbefore I knew it to be his. As to the right of acquiringterritory I agree with the Senator fromNew York that it is embraced, without going further,both in the far and trenty powers. Admitting,then, what has never been denied, and whatit would he idle to do so in a discussion which relatesto territories acquired both by war and treaties,that the United Stales have the right to acquire territories,it would seem to follow, by necessary consequence,that they have the right In govern them.As-they possess the entire right of the soil, dominion,and sovereignty over them, they must necessarilycarry with them the right to govern. But thisgovernment, as the sole agent and representativeof the United States—that is. the States of theUnion in their federal character, must, as such,possess the sole right, if it exists at all. But ifthere be any one disposed to take a different viewof the origin of the power, I shall make no pointswith him, for whatever may be its origin, the conclusionwould be the same, as I shall presentlyshow. But it would be a great error to conclude thatCongress has the absolute power of governing theTerritories, because it has the sole or exclusivepower. The reverse is the case. It is subject tomany and important restrictions and conditions, ofwhish some are expressed and others implied.Among the former may be classed all the generaland absolute prohibitions of the Constitution: that,is, all those which prohibit the exercise of certainpowers under any circumstance. In this class isincluded the prohibition of granting titles of nobility;passing ex post facto laws and bills of attainder;the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus,except in certain cases; making laws respectingthe establishment of religion, or prohibiting its freeexercise; and every other of like description, whichconclusively shows that the power of Congressover the territories is not absolute. Indeed, it is agreat error to suppose, that either this or the StateGovernments possess, in any case, absolute power.such power can belong only to the supreme ultimatepower called sovereignty, and that, in oursystem, resides in the people of the several Statesof the Union. With us, Governments, both Federaland State, are but agents, or, more properly, trustees,and, as such, possess, not absolute, but subordinateand limited powers; for nil powers possessedby such Governments must from theirnature be trust powers, and subject to the restrictionsto which that class of powers belong. ex post facto habeas corpus Among them, they are restricted to the natureand the objects of the trusts; and hence no Governmentunder our system, Federal or Stale, has theright lo do any thing inconsistent with the natureof the powers entrusted to it, or the objects forwhich it was entrusted, or to express it in moreusual language, for which it was delegated. To doeither would be to pervert the power to purposesnever intended, and be a violation of the Constitution,and that in the most dangerous way it couldbe made, because more easily done and less easilydetected. But there is another and important classof restrictions which more directly relate to thesubject under discussion; I refer to those imposedon the trustees by the nature and character of theparty, who constituted the trustees and investedthem with the trust powers to be exercised for itsbenefit. In this case it is the United States—thatis, the several States of the Union, It was theywho constituted the Government as their representativeor trustee, and entrusted it with powersto be exercised for their common and joint benefit.To them in their united character, the territoriesbelong, as is expressly declared by the constitution.They are their joint and common owners,regarded as property or land; and in them, severally,reside the dominion and sovereignty over them.They are as much the territories of one State asAnother—Virginia as of New York; of the Southernas the Northern States. They are the territoriesof all, because they are the territories of each;and not of each, because they are the territories ofthe whole. Add to this the perfect equality of dignity,as well as rights, which appertain to them asmembers of a common federal Union, which allwriters on the subject admit to be a fundamentaland essential relation between the States so united,and it must be manifest that Congress, in governingthe Territories, can give no preference or advantageto one State over another, or to one portion or sectionof the Onion over another, without deprivingthe State or section over which the preference isgiven, or from which the advantage is withheld,of their clear and unquestionable, right subvertingthe very foundation on which the Union andGovernment rest. It has no more power to do sothan to subvert the Constitution itself. Indeed, theact itself would he its subversion. It would destroythe relation of equality on the part of the SouthernStates, and sink them to more dependence of theNorthern, to the total destruction of the federalUnion. I have now shown, I trust, beyond controversy,that Congress has no power whatever to excludethe citizens of the Southern States from emigratingwith their property into the Territories of the U.Stales, or to give an exclusive monopoly of them tothe North. I now propose to go one stop further,and show, that neither the inhabitants of the Territoriesnor their Legislatures have any such right.A very few words will be sufficient for the purpose;for, of all the positions over taken, I hold thatwhich claims the power for them, to be the mostabsurd. If the Territories belong to the UnitedStates, if the ownership, dominion and sovereigntyover them be in the States of this Union, then neitherthe inhabitants of the Territories, nor theirlegislatures, can exercise any power but what issubordinate to them; but, if the contrary couldbe shown, which I hold to be impossible, it wouldbe subject to all the restrictions to which I haveshown the power of Congress is, and for the samereason, whatever power they might hold, would,in the case supported, be subordinate to the Constitution,and controlled by the nature and characterof our political institutions. But if the reverse betrue, if the dominion and sovereignty over the Territoriesbe in their inhabitants instead of the UnitedStates, they would indeed, in that , have theexclusive and absolute power of governing them,and might exclude whom they pleased and whatthey pleased. But in that case, they would ceaseto be the territories of the United States the momentwe acquired them and permitted them to be inhabited.The first half dozen of squatters would becomethe sovereigns, with full dominion and sovereigntyover then, and the conquered people ofNew Mexico and California would become thesovereigns of the country as soon as they becamethe Territories of the United States, vested withthe full right of excluding even their conquerors.There is no escaping from the alternative but byresorting to the greatest of all absurdities, that ofa divided sovereignty—a sovereignty, a part ofwhich would beside in the United States, and a partin the inhabitants of the Territory. How can soveignty,the ultimate and supreme law of a State, bedivided? The exercise of the powers of sovereigntymay be divided, but how can there be two supremepowers?  We are next told that die laws of Mexico precludeslavery; and, assuming that they will remainin force until repeated, it is contended that, untilCongress passes an act for their repeat, the citizensof the South cannot emigrate with their propertyinto the territory acquired from her. I admitthe laws of Mexico prohibit not slavery, but slaveryin the form it exists with us. The peons are asmuch slaves as our negroes, and are less intelligentand well treated. But I deny that the laws ofMexico can have the effect attributed to them. Assoon as the treaty between the two countries isratified, the sovereignty and authority of Mexicoin the territory acquired by it, becomes extinct,and the United Suites is substituted in its place,carrying with it the Constitution, with its overridingcontrol over all the laws and institutions ofMexico inconsistent with it. It is true, the municipallaws of the territory not inconsistent withthe condition and the nature of our political systemwould, according to the writers on the laws of nations,remain, until changed, not as a matter ofright, but merely of sufferance, and as betweenthe inhabitants of the territory, in order to avoid astate of anarchy, before they can be brought underour laws. This is the utmost limits to which sufferancegoes. Under it the peon system wouldcontinue, but not to the exclusion of such, of ourcitizens as may choose in emigrate with their slavesor other property that may be excluded by the lawsof Mexico. The humane provisions of the lawsof nations go no further than to protect those tantsin their property and civil  the former laws, until others can be extend them further and give them the  excludingemigrants from the United States their property or religion are such as are from being introduced by the  of Mexicowould not only exclude a guest majority of thepeople of the United States from emigrating intothe acquired territory, but would be to give higherauthority to the extinct authority of Mexico overthe territory than to our actual authority over it.I say the great majority—for the laws of Mexiconot only prohibit the introduction of slaves, but ofmany other descriptions of property, and also theProtestant religion, which Congress itself cannotprohibit. To such absurdity would the supposion lead.         I have now concluded the discussion, so far asit relates to the power, and have, I trust, established,beyond controversy, that the territories are freeand open to till the citizens of the United States,and that there is no power, under any aspect thesubject can be viewed in, by which the citizens ofthe South can be excluded from emigrating withtheir property into any of them. I have advancedno argument which I do not believe to be true, norpushed any one beyond what truth would strictlywarrant. But, if mistaken, if my arguments, insteadof being sound and true, as I hold them beyondcontroversy to be, should turn out to be amere mass of sophisms, and if, in consequence, thebarrier opposed by the want of power should besurmounted, there is another still in the way thatcannot be. The mere possession of power is notof itself sufficient to justify its exercise. It mustbe, in addition, shown that in the given case it canbe rightfully and justly exercised. Under our systemsthe first inquiry is, Does the constitution authorizethe exercise of the power? If that he decidedin the affirmative, the next is, Can it be rightfullyand justly exercised under the circumstances?And it is not until that too is decided in the affirmative,that the question of the expediency of exercisingit, is presented for consideration. Now, I put the question solemnly to the Senatorsfrom the North: Can you rightly and justly excludethe South from territories of the United Suites, andmonopolize them for yourselves, even, if in youropinion, you should have the power? It is thatquestion I wish to press on your attention, with alldue solemnity and decorum. The North and theSouth stand in the relations of partners in a commonUnion, with equal dignity and equal rights.We of the South have contributed our full share offunds, and shed our full share of blood for the acquisitionof our territories. Can you, then, on anyprinciple of equity and justice, deprive us of ourfull share in their benefit and advantages? Areyou ready to affirm that a majority of the partnersin a joint concern have the right to monopolize itsbenefits to the exclusion of the minority, even incases where they have contributed their full shareto the concern? But in present the ease morestrongly and vividly, I shall descend from generalsto particulars, and shall begin with the OregonTerritory. Our title to it is founded first, and inmy opinion mainly, on our purchase of Louisiana;that was strengthened by the Florida treaty, whichtransferred to us the title also of Spain, and bothby the discovery of the mouth of Columbia riverby Capt. Gary, and the exploration of the entirestream, from its source down to its mouth, by Lewisand Clark. The purchase of Louisiana cost fifteen millionsof dollars; and we paid Spain five millions for theFlorida treaty, making twenty in all. The discoverywas made, it is true, by a citizen of Massachusetts,but he sailed under the flag and protection of theUnion, and of course whatever title was derivedfrom his discovery, accrued to the benefit of theUnion. The exploration of Lewis and Clark wasat the expense of the Union. We are now aboutforming is into a territory; the expense of governingwhich, while it remains so, must be met out ofthe common fund, and towards which the Southmust contribute her full share. The expense willnot be small. Already there is an Indian war tobe put down, and a regiment for that purpose, andto protect the territory, has been ordered there. Towhat extent the expense may extend we know not,but will, not improbably, involve millions beforethe territory becomes a State. I now ask, is itright; is it just; niter having contributed our fullshare for the acquisition of territory, with the liabilityof contributing, in addition to the full shareof the expense for its government, that we shouldbe shut out of the territory, and be excluded fromparticipating in its benefits?—what would bethought of such conduct in the case of individuals?And can that be right and just in government,which any right-minded man would cry out to bebase and dishonest in private life? If it would beso pronounced in a partnership of thirty individuals,how can it be pronounced otherwise in one ofthirty States? The case of our recently acquired territory fromMexico, is, if possible, more marked. The eventsconnected with the requisition are ton well knownto require e long narrative, It was won by arms.and a great sacrifice of men and money; the South,in the contest, performed her full share of militaryduty, and earned a full share of military honor;has poured out her full share of blood freely, andhas and will bear a full share of the expense; hasevinced a full share of skill and bravery, and if Iwere to say even  than her full share of both,I would not go beyond the truth; to be attributed,however, to no superiority, either respect, but toaccidental circumstances, which gave its officersand soldiers more favorable opportunities for theirdisplay.  All have done their duty nobly, and high courageand gallantry are but common attributes of ourpeople. Would it be right to close a territory thuswon against the South, and leave it open exclusivelyto the North? Would it deserve the nameof free soil, if one half of the Union should be excluded,and the other half monopolize it, when itwas won by the joint expense and joint efforts ofall? Is the great law to be reversed—that whichis won by all should be equally enjoyed by all? These are questions which address themselves more to the heart than the head. Feeble must bethe intellect which does not see what is right andjust, and bad must be the heart, unless unconsciousunder the control of deep and abiding prejudice,which hesitates in pronouncing on which side theyare to be found. Now, I put the question to you,Senators from the North, what are you prepared todo? Are you prepared to prostrate the barriers ofThe Constitution, and, in open defiance of the dic-tales of equity and justice, to exclude the South>from the territories, and monopolize them for theNorth? It so, vote against the amendment offeredby the Senator from Mississippi, [Mr. Davis,] and ifthat should fail, vote against striking out the 12thsection. We shall know what to expect. If not,place us upon some ground where we can stand asequals in rights and dignity, and where we shallnot be excluded from what has been acquired atthe common expense, and won by common skilland gallantry. All we demand is to stand on thesame level with yourselves, and to participateequally in what belongs to all. Less we cannottake. I turn now to my friends of the South, and ask,what are you prepared to do? If neither the barriersof the Constitution nor the high sense of rightand justice should prove sufficient to protect you,are you prepared to sink down into a state of acknowledgeinferiority; to be stripped of your dignityof equals among equals, and be deprived ofyour equality of rights in this federal partnershipof States? If so, you are woefully degenerated fromyour sires, and will well deserve to change conditionwith your slaves; but if not, prepare to meetthe issue. The Time tune is at hand, if the questionshould not be speedily settled, when the Southmust rise up, and bravely defend herself or sinkdown into base and acknowledged inferiority, andit is because I clearly perceive that that period isfavorably settling it, if it in ever to be settled, that Iam in favor of preening the question not to a decision—not because I any desire whatever toembarrass either party in reference to the Presidentialelection. At no other period could the twogreat parties into which the country is divided, bemade to see and feel to clearly and intensely theembarrassment and danger caused by the question.Indeed, they Must be blind not to perceive thatthere is a power in action that must burst asunderthe ties that bind them together, strong as theyare, unless it should be speedily settled. Now isthe time, if ever. Cast your eyes to the North,and mark what is going on there; reflect on thetendency of events for the last three years in referenceto this most vital of all questions, and you mustsee that no time should he lost. I am thus brought to the question, How can thequestion be settled? It can, in my opinion, be finallyand permanently adjusted in but one way, andthat is on the high principles of justice and theConstitution. Fear not to leave it to them. Theless you do the letter. If the North and Southcannot stand together on their broad foundation,there is none other on which the) can. If the obligationsof the Constitution and of justice be toofeeble to command the respect of the North, howcan the South expect that she will regard the farmore feeble obligations of an act of Congress? Norshould the North fear, that, by leaving it where justiceand the Constitution leave it, she would be includedfrom her full share of territories. In myopinion, if left there,climate, soil, and other circumstanceswould fix the fine between the slaveholding and the non-slaveholding States in about36.30. It may zigzag a little, to accommodate itselfto circumstances—sometimes passing to theNorth and at others passing to the South of it;but that would matter little, and would be moresatisfactory to all, and tend less to alienation betweenthe two great sections, than a rigid, straight,artificial line, prescribed by an act of Congress. And here let me say to Senators from the Northyou make a great mistake in supposing that weportion which might fall to the South of whateverline might be drawn, if left to soil and chromate, andcircumstances to determine, would be closed to thewhite labor of the North, became it could not minglewith slave labor without degradation. Thefact is not so. There is no part of the world whereagricultural, mechanical, and other descriptions oflabor are more respected than in the South, withthe exception of two descriptions of employment—that of mental and body servants. No Southernman—not the poorest or the lowest—will underany circumstances, submit to either of them. Hehas too much pride for that, and I rejoice that hehas. They are consisted to the spirit of a freeman.But the man who would spurn them feels not theleast degradation to work in the same field or inany other mechanical operation; and when so employed,they claim the right, and are admitted, inthe country portion of the South, of sitting at thetable of their employers. Can a much, on thescore of equality be said for the North? with usthe two great divisions of society are not the richand poor, but white and black; and all the former,the poor as well as the rich, belong to the upperclass, and are respected and treated as equals ifhonest and industrious; and hence have a positionand pride of character of which neither poverty normisfortune can deprive them. But I go further, and hold that justice and theConstitution are the easiest and safest grounds onwhich the question can be settled, regarded in referenceto party. It may settled on that groundsimply by non-action-by leaving the territoriesfree and open to the emigration of all the world,as long as they continue so, and when they becomeStates, to adopt whatever constitution they please,with the single restriction, to be republican, in orderto their admission into the Union. If a partycannot safely take this broad and social positionand successfully maintain it, what other can it takeand maintain? If it cannot maintain itself by anappeal to the great principles of justice, the Constitution,and self-government, to what other, sufficientlystrong to uphold them in public opinion,can they appeal? I greatly mistake the characterof the people of this Union if such an appeal wouldnot prove successful, if either party should havethe magnanimity to step toward and boldly makeit. It would, in my opinion, he received with shoutsof approbation by the patriotic and intelligent inevery quarter. There is a deep feeling prevailingin the country, that the Union and our political institutionsare in danger, which such a course woulddispel, and spread joy over the land. Now is the time to take the step, and bring abouta result so devoutly to be wished. I have believedfrom the beginning, that this was the only questionsufficiently potent to dissolve the Union, and subvertour system of government; and that the soonerit was met and settled, the safer and better forall. I have never doubted but that it permitted toprogress beyond a certain point, its settlementwould become impossible, and an under a deepconviction that it is now rapidly approaching it,and that if it is ever to be averted, it must be donespeedily. In uttering these opinions I look to thewhole. If I speak earnestly, it is to save and protectall. As deep as is the stake of the South inthe Union and our political institutions, it is notdeeper than that of the North. We shall be aswell prepared and as capable of meeting whatevermay come, as you. Now, let my say, Senators, if our Union and systemof government are doomed to perish, and weto share the fate of so many great people who havegone before us, the historian, who, in some futureday, may record the events tending to so calamitousa result, will devote his first chapter to theordinance of 87, a landed as it and its authorshave been, as the first in that series which led to it.His next chapter will be devoted to the Missouricompromise, and the next to the present agitation.Whether there will be another beyond, I know not.It will depend on what we may do. If he should possess a philosophical turn of mind,and be disposed to look to more remote and reconditecauses, he will trace it to a propositionwhich originated in a hypothetical truism, butwhich, as now expressed and understood, is themost false and dangerous of all political errors.The proposition to which I allude has become anaxiom in the minds of a vast majority on both sidesof the Atlantic, and is repeated daily from tongueto tongue, as an established and incontrovertibletruth; it is, that 'all men are born free and equal.'I am not afraid to attack error however deeply itmay be entrenched, or however widely extended,whatever it becomes my duty to do so, as I believeit to be on this subject and occasion.  Taking, the proposition literally, (it is in thatsense it is understood, there is not a word of truthin It begins with 'all men are horn,' which isutterly untrue. Men are not born. Infants are born.They grow to be men. And concludes by assertingthat they are born 'free and equal,' which isnot less false. They are not born free. While infants,they are incapable of freedom, being destitutealike of the capacity of thinking and actingwithout which there run be no freedom. Besidesthey are necessarily born subject to their parents,and. remain so among all people, savage and civilizeduntil the developments of their intellect andphysical capacity enable them to lake care of them.selves. They grow to all the freedom, of whichthe condition in which they were born permits, byby growing to be men. Nor is it less false thatthey are born 'equal' They are not so in anysense in which it can be regarded; and thus, as Ihave asserted. there is not a word of truth in thewhole proposition, as and understood. If we trace it back, we shall find the propositiondifferently expressed in the Declaration of IndependenceThat asserts that 'all men are createdequal.' The form of expression, though less dangerous,is not less erroneous. All men are notcreated. According to the Bible, only two, a manand a woman, ever were, and of these one was pronouncedsubordinate to the other. All others havecome into the world by being born, and in no othersense, as I have shown, either free or equal.But this form of expression being less striking andpopular, has given way to the present, and underthe: authority of a document put forth on so greatan occasion, and leading to such important consequences,has spread far and wide, and fixed itselfdeeply in the public mind. It was inserted in ourDeclaration of Independence without any necessity.It made no necessary part of our justification inseparating from the parent country, and declaringourselves independent. Breach of our charteredprivileges, and lawless encroachment on our acknowledgedand well-established rights by the parentcountry, were the real Causes, and of themselvessufficient, without resorting to any other, tojustify the step. Nor had it any weight in constructingthe governments, which were substitutedin the places of the colonial. They were formedof the old materials, and on practical and well establishedprinciples, borrowed for the most partfrom our own experience and that of the countryfrom which we sprang. If the proposition be traced still farther back, itwill be found to have been adopted from certainwriters on government, who had attained muchcelebrity in the early settlement of these States,and with whose writings all the prominent actorsin our revolution were familiar. Among these,Locke and Sidney were prominent. But they expressedit very differently. According to theirexpression, 'all men in the state of nature werefree and equal.' From this the others were derived;and it was this to which I referred when Icalled it a hypothetical truism. To understandwhy will require some explanation. Man, for the purpose of reasoning, may be regardedin three different states: in a state of individuality;that is, living by himself apart from therest of his species. In the social; that is, living insociety, associated with others of his species. Andin the political; that is, being under government.We may reason as to what would be his rightsand duties. in either, without taking into considerationwhether he could exist in it or not. It is certain,that in the first, the very supposition that helived apart and separated from all others, wouldmake him free and equal. No one, in such a state,could have the: right to command or control another.Every man would be his own master, andnight do just as he pleased. But it is equally clearthat man cannot exist in such a state; that he is bynature social, and that society is necessary, not onlyto the proper development of all his faculties, moraland intellectual, but to the very existence of hisrace. Such being the case, the state is a purelyhypothetical one; and when we say all men arefree and equal in it, we announce a mere hypotheticaltruism; that is, it truism resting on a meresupposition that cannot exict, and of course one oflittle or no practical value. But to call it a state of nature was a great misnomer,and has led to dangerous errors; for thatcannot justly be called a state of nature, which isso opposed to the constitution of man as to be inconsistentwith the existence of his race, and the developmentof the high faculties, mental and moral,with which be is endowed by the Creator. Nor is the social state of itself his natural state,for society can no more exist without government,in one form or another, than man without society.It is the political, then, which includes the social,that is his natural state. It is the one for whichhis Creator formed him, into which he is impelledirresistibly, and in which only his race can existand all his faculties be fully developed. Such being the case, it follows that any, theworst form of government, is better than anarchy;and that individual liberty, or freedom, most besubordinate to whatever power may be necessaryto protect society against anarchy within or destructionfrom without; for the safely and wellbeingof society are as paramount to individualliberty as the safety and well-being of the race isto that of individuals; and in the same proportionthe Power necessary for the safely of society isparamount to individual liberty On the contrary,government has no right to control individual libertybeyond what is necessary to the safety andwell-being of society. Such is the boundary whichseparates the power of government and the libertyof the citizen or subject in the political state, which,as I have shown, is the natural state of man—theonly one in winch his race can exist, and the onein which he is born, lives, and dies. It follows from all this that the quantum ofpower on the part of the government, and of libertyon that of individuals, instead of being equal in allcases, must necessarily be very unequal amongdifferent people, according to their different conditions.For just in proportion as a people areignorant, stupid, debased, corrupt, exposed to violencewithin, and danger without, the power necessaryfor government to possess in order to preservesociety against anarchy and destruction,becomes greater and greater, and individual libertyextinct. So on the contrary, just as a people risein the scale of intelligence, virtue, and patriotism,and the more perfectly they become acquaintedwith the nature of government, the ends for whichit was ordered, and how it ought to be administered,and the less the tendency to violence anddisorder within, and danger from abroad; thepower necessary for government becomes less andless, and individual liberty greater and greaterlastead, than, of all men having the same right toliberty and equality, as is claimed by those whohold that they are all born free and equal, libertyis the noblest and highest reward bestowed onmental and moral development, combined withfavorable circumstances. Instead, then, of libertyand equality being born with man, instead of allmen and all classes and descriptions being equallyentitled to them, they are high prizes to be won,and are in their most perfect state, not only thehighest reward that can be; bestowed on our race,but the most difficult to be won, and when won,the most difficult to be preserved. They have been made vastly more so, by thedangerous error I have attempted to expose, thatall men are born free and equal, as if those highqualities be longed to man without effort to acquirethem, and to all equally alike, regardless of theirintellectual and moral condition. The attempt tocarry into practice this, the most dangerous of allpolitical errors, and to bestow on all, without regardby their fitness, either to acquire or maintain libertythat unbounded and individual liberty supposedto belong to man in the hypothetical and misnamedstate of nature, has done more to retard the causeof liberty and civilization, and is doing more atpresent, than all other causes combined. Whileit is powerful in pull down governments, it is stillmore powerful to prevent their construction onproper principles. It is the leading cause amongthose who have placed Europe in its present anarchicalcondition, and which mainly stands in theway of reconstructing good governments in theplace of those which have been overthrown, threateningthereby the quarter of the globs moat advicedin progress and civilization, with hopelessanarchy, to be followed by military despotismNot are We exempt from its disorganizing effects.We now begin to experience the danger of admittingso great an error to have a place in the Declarationof our Independence. For a long time inretained dormant; but in the process of time inbegan to germinate, and produce its poisonous fruits.It had strong hold upon the mind of Mr. Jefferson, the author of that document, whichcensed him to take an utterly false view of thesubordinate relation of the black to the white racein the South; and to hold in consequence, thatthe latter, though utterly unqualified to possesliberty, were as fully entitled to both liberty andequality as the former; and that to deprive thenof it, was unjust and immoral. To this error, hisproposition to exclude slavery from the territorynorthwest of the Ohio may be traced, and to thatthe ordinance of '87, and through it the deep anddangerous agnation which now threatens to engulph,and will certainly engulph, if not speedilysettled, our political institutions, and involve thecountry in countless woes.
