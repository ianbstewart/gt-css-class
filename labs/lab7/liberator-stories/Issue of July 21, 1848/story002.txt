 TO HENRY C WRIGHT:DEAR HENRY—I am largely your debtor in thisway. Four times since t last wrote; you, have youaddressed me through the Liberator, in letters ofdeep and abiding interest. Your head is full of matter,bearing on the everlasting interests of man;your heart is full of feeling, prompting you to giveutterance to your deep felt impressions; you have atongue and a pen ready to impress them on all whoare willing to come and hear and read you; andyour faith in the value of laboring to do good, cheersyou on in your valued efforts to spread abroad thoseprinciples of truth and justice which would, if menwere wise enough to adopt and practise them, giveus, even on this earth, a foretust of heaven. Mayyou, my dear friend, be greatly successful in yourlabors. I have some portion of like faith with you,but I want some of your spirit and energy, and couragetoo, to constitute me an active laborer. Surely,the reforms which are now agitating the world, be followed by some good results. Teetotal-I place in the foreground. I can see no hope of anabranch towards permanent comfort and, said the drinking customs of society utterly subdued. Any advances we may, from time to time, in other directions, will becountected, if this vice be not put a stop to. Withyou  is, at all events, scotched. I hopeyou will soon  him outright- With us, muchhas also been effected in this cause; but the reformhad made no progress yet upwards in society. It isstill confined to the working classes. These are, nodoubt, the bone and sinew of society; and if theycan be kept firm to the practice of perfect temperance,the principle will undoubtedly in the end prevail.I am truly sorry to learn from you, that mycountrymen are not found faithful in your land, butwe have many among us who are willing to adoptthe advice—'Get money, my son—honestly, if youcan—but get money'; and truly, this temptation todeaden the conscientious scruples, which no doubtaffect many, is great, for the god which men worshipmost assiduously is gold. O ENRY RIGHT EAR ENRY           I cannot attempt lo reply at length to all your interestingletters; but I must glance at each, andpass hastily on, so as not lo occupy an unreasonablespace in the Liberator, through which channelI must address you, as I know of none other, youare now so thoroughly locomotive, whirling fromplace to place by the aid of those snorting and fierysteeds which put time and space almost at defiance,and which enable a man, laboring as you are doing,to live twice as long in the same number of daysor years, as would have been possible but a fewyears ago. The car of improvement is not, after all,a slow-moving, lumbering machine, but a vehiclewhich speeds along like lightning. What signifiesa score or an hundred years, in the course of Time?And yet, if we look buck, an hundred years in theworld's history, what mighty works have been performedwithin the time! But those are as nothing,compared with-what a similar future will bringforth. Your first letter is in the Liberator of April 7th,and your second in the number of the 28th of thesame. They both refer to the report on the organizationof your State militia; and indeed that mustbe considered a curious document by the uninitiated.I had an idea that a regular army was held togetherby the pains and penalties you have referred to, butI was not aware that a militia', a band of free citizensassociated together for mutual defence, was socompletely and unmistakably a band of slaves; butyou have revealed this fact to me, and no doubt tomany others, who will now have no difficulty in understandingwhy it is that, in spite of all the glitterand false ideas of honor which are cast against themilitary profession, that only 4500, out of your90,000 free and intelligent citizens, should be foundwilling to place themselves in so horrible a positionas you have graphically described it to be. This isindependently, altogether, of any qualms of consciencewhich might-be supposed to arise, in such acommunity, because of such an infamous attempt toreconcile the life of a soldier with, the duties of aChristian. I could understand, and honor the man,too, who came honestly forward, and declared thatthe religion taught by Jesus was but the mere delusionof a well-meaning enthusiast, and not to be regardedby sensible men. But I cannot respect thesoldier who professes to be a Christian, the dailypractice of whose life is in opposition to the peacefulprinciples which, by his profession, he admits shouldguide his conduct. Yet the soldier is not any moreblameable than all those who sustain him in his career.He seems to me to hold the same relation inregard to war, that the distiller does in regard todrunkenness, and the slaveholder in regard toslavery; none of these could exist if the public sentimentaround them did not sanction their evil practices.War and drunkenness are upheld in thisland by all that is respectable about us. -You meetwith scarcely an individual, who does nut maintainthat the good order of society (in spite of all experienceto the contrary) can only be secured by themaintenance of an armed force to keep bad men fromdoing mischief. When I argue that our only realdanger arises from the presence of soldiers amongstus, I am looked upon as a visionary; when I pointto the evils produced in all times by the use of violentmeasures, to punish wrong doers, I am told thatcrime would be still more abounding, if it had notbeen for the adoption of those very means I reprobate,[find it nearly impossible to edge in my peaceprinciples at present; They find no favor with anyparty. Violent counsels prevail almost universallyso that we are just standing on the volcano thatmay burst out on any day, and pour destruction allaround. On the one hand, we hate Governmentarmed to the teeth; her lured slaughterers filleven our halls of science. If you were here now,and I should take you through our Royal DublinSociety; an institution founded to promote the peacefuland healthful pursuits of agriculture, you wouldsee its passages bristling with bayonets, and crowdedwith men in the livery or blood, who, like theirown fiery agent—gunpowder—lie harmlessly around,until the spark is applied, which turns them at onceinto demons of desolation. On the other hand, wehave the people dissatisfied, and only wailing a favorableopportunity to imbrue their bands in blood,actually hoping and praying that a general Europeanwar may give them a chance of repealing the. Unionwith England by violence, which they have not thepatience nor the courage to accomplish by peacefulmeans. This is an unpleasant position for thesecountries to be placed in, and yon will readily perceivethat, so long as it exists, there is little chancethat the 'still small voice' of Christianity will beheard and attended to. Yet we must not be 'wearyin well-doing,' nor give up in despair. We may yetsucceed in bringing right principles to maturity, and,at all events, it is pleasant to be striving to do good. The stirring events which have occurred in Europewithin the brief period of a few months, are indeedenough to excite wonder and astonishment.For a time, and even yet, they caused a feeling ofhops in the breasts of the friends of human progress,and of human improvement, but I cannot any that Ihave participated in this feeling. Violent meanshave been resorted to by the people; the combativeand destructive principles of our being have beenagain, strongly culled into action, and I fear the trueprinciples of freedom will never spring up or thrivein such soil. It is true that moderate measures findmany advocates, and that the hopes of enlightenedmen every where seem lo be fixed on peace, or theabsence of further bloodshed, is the only true securityfor the establishment of freedom. In France, aglorious opportunity wan indeed given to Lumartine,and the friends of pence, and well may you exclaim,'Why did they not disband the army, and blot fromtheir nation the last vestige of military power;, thevery serpent that stung them, and will sting themagain, whenever it sees fit to do so? They had nofaith—there is no faith yet—in the efficacy of moralmeans fur the regeneration of our race. Whethermen will ever fully comprehend this great truth, isdoubtful. All we yet know about is, that it eatersnot into the minds of any considerable number ofeven the most enlightened of our in the presentday. When I look at the history of mankind, andsee depicted on its every page,  woe and miseryin every conceivable shape have been the result ofviolent means to obtain even righteous ends, I amamazed that even the little wisdom and commonsense we possess, have not induced us before thistime of day to try some other means of righting ourwrongs, and of promoting harmony in the world.I am constantly told that, if all men would consentto follow peace, it would be a happy thing for mankind,but that it would be dangerous for us to showsuch an example by putting away all preparation forwar. In other Words, it would be wrong fur us todo right, until others consented to do so too. Formy part, I believe it is always safe to do right, andthat if, in this instance, England, or America, orFrance, or any other nation, were to disband all theirmilitary forces, and declare that she would no longerdepend on such means for existence, such anact of heroism would excite the admiration of mankind,and be productive of the happiest results.Then would her rulers govern according to the rulesof equity; then would her people seek, for neededreforms by peaceful and Christian means, and thatnation need fear no wrong, for 'peace would be inall her borders, and prosperity in oil her palaces.' 'Why did they not disband the army, and blot fromtheir nation the last vestige of military power; know  I have been much interested in the description yougive me (in the Liberator of 26th May) of Mr. Everett'shousehold and farm operations, and as yougive his condition as a fair sample of that of hisclass in New England, I must admit that such physicaland intellectual comforts as his, is the lot of Veryfew farmers in any poor country. But then, Mr. Everettis a rich man; he would be considered so amongfarmers in any land; and farmers of his class, evenin Ireland, are a comfortable race of men, who livevery well, according to their ideas of comfort. Thegreat, the important, difference between them, I imagine,is to be found in the intellectual acquirementsof the parties; Having never led a country life, Iam not, myself, personally acquainted with the habitsof our farmers; but I have learned from frequentinquiry, that those among them, who hold from oneto two hundred acres of land, at a fair rent, are quitewell off in their circumstances. They do not live insuch good houses as your New England farmers occupy,not generally having a taste for so many of theluxuries of life. Many of 'this class work very industriouslyon their farms, and heir wives anddaughters, as well as their sons, assist them steadilyin all their pursuits; but intellectually, I should say,they are nearly nil far below the standard you havesketched, and in refinement the difference is quite asgreat. The hired laborers of these men are verylow in the scale indeed, earning miserable wages,say from 4s. 1065. per week, out of which, togetherwith any trifle their wives and children may be ableoccasionally to pick up, and perhaps a small plot ofpotatoes, they must provide for all their wants of rent,food. clothing, &c, so that you may readily conceivethat their manner of life must be poor indeed. Mentalwants are nut thought of by these; perhaps onthe Sunday, they gather round some tolerably goodrender, and listen to the news of the day, from a papera week old. The farmers in Ireland, who hold 100or 200 acres of land, are few in number; the greatbulk of them must drag out a. miserable existencein hovels unfit for human beings to dwell in, out ofthe produce of some five or ten acres of land, forwhich, in many canes, they have to pay, what is calledin forcible language, a 'rack rent.' This largeclass of Irish farmers are little, if at all, above thelaborer, in the scale of 'comfort; and how the conditionof these is to be wended, I know not; the taskof improvement seems to be a hopeless one. Withyou, land is illimitable in extent, so that many centuriesmust elapse before population can press seriouslyon the means of existence. With us, on thecontrary, our surface is small in extent, and thisnatural disadvantage is greatly aggravated by manylegal difficulties which prevent the transfer of land,so that, in many parts of the country, Immense districtsare wretchedly, or not at all, cultivated, becausethey happen to be in the hands of men withoutcapital, who are as proud as they are poor, and whosebroad acres are tied up by mortgages and marriagesettlements, which doom them to everlasting barrenness.Some alterations must be made in our landlaws, and in our mode of land tenure. The law ofprimogeniture, which hands down castes from latherto eldest son for generations, must be abolished, and gives for the purchase of land in small luxuries of life. Many of 'this class work very the day centuriesmust elapse before population can press seriously  quantities; but these alterations is our laws andcustoms will be difficult of accomplishment, becauseof the power of our landholders in the Legislature;and this influence they will not yield, until publicopinion becomes sufficiently powerful to compel themto do so. National prejudices, in regard to foods, are verystrong and very singular. Your New England menlook on oatmeal as greatly inferior to Indian meal;our people give the former a decided preference;the present difference in value here is about 2s per112 lbs. in favor of oatmeal. The quantity of Indianmeal now consumed in Ireland is very large, and itwill probably increase very much, as our people arebeginning to like it greatly. I read your extract about Teetotalism at our meetingin Cuffe lane, this evening. It is a sad disgraceto us that Irishmen should be such drunkards anddrunkard-makers in America, as you state them tobe. I wish my voice could reach every one of them,and I would implore them, by all their lave of fatherland,to avoid such hateful practices. You haveoften remarked on the sobriety of the people of Dublin.This good conduct well characterizes our, faircity. Thanks to Father Spratt, we are stilt a soberpeople. Our fine open air meetings are still heldoccasionally, and noble gatherings they are. But wecan make no impression upon the rich; their exampleis all given on the side of drunkenness and immorality,so that I am often amazed at the steadinessof the poor. May God grant that they shallalways continue so. Father Mathew has had an attackof paralysis, which is a very afflictive circumstance.He has labored hard and well in this goodwork, and his influence is still much needed in a fieldin which we have few willing husbandmen. You claim your usual place on Saturdays, at ourboard; but that's all moonshine, Henry. I can'tsee you, I can't hear you, I can't shake your hand;you're thousands of miles off, and the probability is,that we shall never meet again in this world; but ourspirits will mingle—you'll preach peace, and anti-slavery,and temperance, on a scale large as the wideextent of your prairies, and lofty as your toweringmountains. You'll travel thousands of mites, spreadingabroad the doctrine of 'peace on earth, and goodwill to man.' I'll do so too, but on a smaller scale,and each of us will gather strength, occasionally,from the reflection that each in similarly engaged. I have sent you several papers; I, hope some or allof them have reached you. My family are all ingood health. Mary has been away from us sixmonths, but she is to be home this week I amstill living on a vegetable diet, and my only drinksare milk and water. In this plain way, I get on admirably,so that I have no idea of changing my practice. It is time fur me to bring this long epistle to aclose. It is now Thursday evening, and past 11o'clock, so that I am all alone in my study. I commencedon Sunday, and I have proceeded by instalments,as leisure occurred; and I send off my productionwithout alteration or correction of any kind. If our friend Garrison shall deem it worthy a placein the: Liberator, you'll see me again in print. Ifnot, he will forward my scratch to you, some howor other. You are such a locomotive machine, Ishould not know where to address you. Your friend, affectionately, JAMES HAUGHTON.
