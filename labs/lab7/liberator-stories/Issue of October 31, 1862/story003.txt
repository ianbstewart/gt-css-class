 Do the people of Indiana desire their State to beoverrun with lazy, helpless and thriftless negroes?Do they want the State to be Africanized? Largenumbers have already been brought into the State,in violation of our Constitutional provisions againstsuch immigration. If Lincoln's Proclamation is carriedinto effect, our State will be flooded with apopulation, which, by an overwhelming vote of thepeople, it was determined to exclude. By order ofthe Secretary of War, thousands of contrabands,men, women and children, are being carried intoIllinois. The same thing is going on in Ohio. Unlessprotested against, the Federal military authoritieswill Africanize the Western States. We do notwant that imputation amongst us. We do not wantthe industry of the State taxed for their support.We have already burdens enough, without this additionto them. If Abolitionism triumphs at thepolls to-morrow, our State will be flooded with negroes,devouring our substance like the locusts ofEgypt. The only remedy for this threatened evilis to elect men to Congress, who will insist that thelocal laws and policy of the State shall be respectedby the officers of the general government, and bythe election of a Legislature and public officers whowill see that the laws are faithfully executed. Thereis no hope that a Republican Legislature or Republicanofficers, unless constrained by heavy fines andpenalties, will do their duty in preventing the immigrationof negroes. The white men of Indianamust not be degraded by placing the negro in competitionwith them in the workshops, or in any departmentof labor.â€”Indiana State Sentinel, Oct. 10.
