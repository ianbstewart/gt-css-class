 The swach-bucklers have vapered and braggedhave scorned and reviled the "damned Yankeepodlers," and "mudsills," and "greasy mechanics,"whose fathers were the "canting" Puritans of theMayflower, and gentlemen from the beginning.More than thirty years ago, South Carolina Haynerose in the Senate, on the great question of theright of a State to nullify; and, as the representativeman of his State, he vituperated, and spatupon, and scorned, and insulted the glorious oldBay State. It was the first flash and murmur ofthe gathering storm, but Webster's great eyesquenched his lightning, and flashed annihilationupon him, and the thunder of his eloquence, as itswept over the audacious Southron, and wreckedhim into immortality, was like the thunder of thesea, learned by the Massachusetts Senator on hisMarshfield beaches. gentlemen In 1846, Judge Hoar was sent by Massachusettsto South Carolina, to test in the courts the constitutionalityof the law to imprison our citizens inSouth Carolina jails, for no crime but the color oftheir skin; to see if a colored sailor could of rightbe taken from his vessel, and shut away in a cellduring the time the vessel remained in a Southernport. The man, whose name was a synonym forintegrity and honor, took his daughter, and wentdown to the city of Charleston, to that Southernhospitality, to that Southern chivalry, to those "highbredgentlemen"—forsooth! And how did they receivehim? They gathered—a raging, brutal, Furiousmob—against him, and drove him out with indignityand insult, and in fear of his life. highbredgentlemen Eight years ago, Charles Sumner was struckdown in the Senate-chamber, by that same brutaland cowardly "chivalry." They thought thus to insultMassachusetts through one of her truest andnoblest sons, but it is impossible for the base to insultthe noble. *The civilised world heard of thatfoul deed with abhorrence and disgust, but the barbarismof South Carolina had taught her nothingbetter than to glory in her shame. She applaudedand feted the instrument of her disgrace, presentedhim with canes unnumbered, and at last buried hisfetid body, in all the dishonor of her praise, under alying heap of marble. * Year after year have these things gone on, butthe day of reckoning has come at last, a terribleretribution knocks at her ocean doors. Justice hasput on "her robes of hell-fire," and in the thunderof cannon, in the flame and smoke of battle, Carolinais called to her account. Has not Nemesis alwaysfollowing closely on the heels of sin, come upwith her at last? Is it not poetical justice thatMassachusetts men are investing Charleston, andforcing her nearer and nearer to a sure surrender?That Beauregard, who performed the mighty exploitof taking Sumter against a half-starved handfulof fifty-six men, should now be forced to defendit in vain, and see its walls crumble before his eyes,after two years granted to him to build his fortificationsand plant his batteries? That Carolina's indictment,"First to begin the war; first to shutup the Federal courts; first to withdraw her membersfrom Congress; first to pass the ordinance ofsecession; first to lay hands on Federal property;first to fire on the national flag;" should be writtenin fire, sealed with the precious blood of heroes,and carried forward to judgment and punishmentby the hands she has most despised? Yes, does itnot pass poetical justice, and become divine, whenwe see the wronged and oppressed race transformedinto valiant soldiers, and rushing with invinciblecourage against the very walls that protecttheir house of bondage, becoming, in God's hands,the house of their deliverance? The thunderof cannon; the dropping of shot into the veryheart of rebeldom; the flight of the inhabitants;the gathering closer and closer of the iron-cladfleet; the noble endurance, the sublime courage,the greed self-sacrifice exhibited before those walls, allwhisper the prophacy, "Charleston is taken!"What vengeance shall be taken on the wickedrebel State? What price shall be exacted for allher wrong and insult? The wrath of the Lamb iskindled at last, and, lo! the vengeance shall takethe form of blessing! She has shut out light, andwe will punish her with a flood of it. She hasbarred her doors against northern intelligence anddiscussion; she has frightened strangers into beingdeaf and blind; a northern gentleman walking inthe streets of Charleston, has been followed by thepolice for days, under the suspicion of being anabolition agent, and only an accident saved himfrom arrest and imprisonment; it was unsafe for atraveller to have a northern newspaper in hispacket. And now all this is changed! Where thearmy goes, newspapers go with them—"pestilent"abolition journals," sufficiently outspoken to driveall the patriarchs mad in the neighborhood. Thesepapers have been issued in Virginia, the Carolinas,Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Tennessee,and the negroes have learned to read them!We wilt punish Carolina by giving northern newspapers,of the freest kind, to all her people, to upliftand enlighten them. And finally, as the bitterest of all punishments,we will bless her barbarism with the gift of freeschools. The music of northern school-bells shallbe heard through all her borders, ringing a benedictionto the outcast and the poor. The gospel ofignorance has been preached there long enough.Yankee schools, Yankee books, Yankee civilization,have been sneered and railed at long enough. Thishas constantly been the cry of the South:— "That it detested schools, of all wicked things inthis wicked world—that spelling promoted infidelity,and that reading made men fanatical—that popularIgnorance was public safety, and popular enlightenmentpublic peril—that the smaller the number of theeducated class, the greater was the stability of thepolitical body. See what common schools have donefor the North! See what newspapers have done forNew England! See how the art of printing has promotedunbelief and scepticism, and the incontinencyof the married and single, until all New England is nobetter than a very bad Sedem—while we!—well, if youwant pure, inflexible, and inimitable virtue, and enlightened,uncompromising, and rational religion—you must look to us." all New England is nobetter than a very bad Sedem Now we will punish them with the blessing theydespite, and sweeping out the fifth of their hence,force them to a higher plane of living, force themto one the dignity and blessedness of labor, forcethem to acknowledge the value of civilization overbarbarism; and being them forth from theirhouse of bondage into the light and glory of permanentprosperity and peace. The song of our fleets and armies, as they advanceto this blessing of punishment, and punishmentof blessing, should be:— "The Day of the Lord is at hand at hand?Its storms sell up the sky;A nation must fall for its wickedness—For its cures of slavery.But the night is darkest before the downWhite the pain is  the child is been,And the Day of the Lord of hand!"        "Gather you, gather you, angels of God—Freedom, and Mercy, and Truth;Come! for the earth is awake in her might,And alive with the vigor of youth!Wisdom, Self-sacrifice, Daring, and Love,Haste to the battle-field, steep from aboveTo the Day of the Lord at head!"       "Gather you, gather you, hounds of hell—Famine, and Pingue, and war;Idleness, Slavery, Cant and Misrtlle,Gather and fall in the snare!Hirelings, Seymourites, Bullies and KnavesCrawl to the Bottle-field—sneak to your gravesIn the Day of the Lord at hand!"       "Who would sit down and sigh for a last ago of gold,While the Lord of all ages is here?Tree hearts will leap up at the trumpet of God,And these who can suffer can dare.Each old age of gold was an iron age too,And the meekest of saints may find stern work to doIn this Day of the Lord at hand!"
